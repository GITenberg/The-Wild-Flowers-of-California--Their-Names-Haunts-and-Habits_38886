<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>To the thoughtless a flower is often a trivial thing&mdash;beautiful
perhaps, and worthy of a passing glance&mdash;but that is all.
But to the mind open to the great truths of the universe, it
takes on a deeper significance. Such a mind sees in its often
humble beginnings the genesis of things far-reaching and
mighty. Two thousand years ago one grain of the shower
of pollen wafted upon the wind and falling upon a minute
undeveloped cone, quickened a seed there into life, and this
dropping into the soil pushed up a tiny thread of green, which,
after the quiet process of the ages, you now behold in the
giant Sequoia which tosses its branches aloft, swept by the
four winds of heaven.</p>

<p>Whether manifesting itself in the inconspicuous flower upon
the tree or in the equally unassuming inflorescence of the vegetable,
or unfurling petals of satin or gauze of brilliant hue and
marvelous beauty, the blossom is the origin of most that is useful
or beautiful in the organic world about us. Strip the world
of its blossoms, and the higher forms of life must come to a
speedy termination. Thus we see the flower playing a wonderfully
important part in the cosmos around us. It becomes
henceforth not only a thing of beauty for the gratification of
the æsthetic sense, but the instrument by which Nature brings
about the fullness of her perfection in her own good season.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There is perhaps no nature-study that can yield the same
amount of pure and unalloyed pleasure with so little outlay as
the study of the wild flowers. When one is interested in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[ viii]</a></span>
every walk into the fields is transformed from an aimless ramble
into a joyous, eager quest, and every journey upon stage
or railroad becomes a rare opportunity for making new plant-acquaintances&mdash;a
season of exhilarating excitement.</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs, that devout lover of nature, says: "Most
young people find botany a dull study. So it is, as taught
from the text-books in the schools; but study it yourself in the
fields and woods, and you will find it a source of perennial
delight. Find your flower, and then name it by the aid of the
botany. There is so much in a name. To find out what a
thing is called is a great help. It is the beginning of knowledge;
it is the first step. When we see a new person who
interests us, we wish to know his or her name. A bird, a
flower, a place&mdash;the first thing we wish to know about it is its
name. Its name helps us to classify it; it gives us a handle to
grasp it by; it sheds a ray of light where all before was darkness.
As soon as we know the name of a thing, we seem to
have established some sort of relation with it."</p>

<p>Having learned the name of a flower or plant, or having
been formally introduced to it, as it were, our acquaintance has
but just begun. Instead of being our end and aim, as it was
with students of botany in the olden times, this is but the beginning.
If this were our ultimate aim, all our pleasure would
be at an end as soon as we had learned the names of all the
plants within our reach. But the point of view has changed
and broadened. The plant is now recognized as a <i>living
organism</i>, not a dead, unchanging thing. It is <i>vital</i>; it grows;
it is amenable to the great laws of the universe; and we see it
daily complying with those laws, adapting itself to its surroundings&mdash;or
perishing. It becomes a thing of absorbing
interest when we trace the steps by which it has come to be
what it is; when we note its relationship to other closely allied
forms, and locate its place in the great world of plants.</p>

<p>A thoughtful observation of the structure of plants alone
will fill the mind with amazement at the beauty of their minutest
parts, the exquisite perfection of every organ. Then it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ ix]</a></span>
is most interesting to notice the various kinds of places where
the same plants grow; how they flourish in different soils and
climates; how they parry the difficulties of new and unaccustomed
surroundings, by some change of structure or habit to
meet the altered conditions&mdash;as clothing themselves with wool,
to prevent the undue escape of moisture, or twisting their
leaves to a vertical position for the same purpose, or sending
their roots deep into the earth to seek perennial sources of
moisture, which enables them to flourish in our driest times.
It is wonderful to note, too, the methods employed to secure
the distribution of the seed&mdash;how it is sometimes imbedded
in a delicious edible fruit, again furnished with hooks or bristles
or springs, or provided with silken sails to waft it away
upon the wings of the wind. Then the insects that visit plants.
It is marvelous to note how plants spread their attractions in
bright colors and perfumes and offerings of honey to bees,
butterflies, and moths that can carry their pollen abroad, and
how they even place hindrances in the way of such as are undesirable.</p>

<p>Studied in this way, botany is no longer the dry science it
used to be, but becomes a most fascinating pursuit; and we
know of no richer field in which to carry on the study of
flowers than that afforded in California.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>There has been a long-felt need of a popular work upon the
wild flowers of California. Though celebrated throughout the
world for their wealth and beauty, and though many of them
have found their way across the waters and endeared themselves
to plant lovers in many a foreign garden, the story of
their home life has never yet been told.</p>

<p>It has been the delightful task of the author and the illustrator
of the present work to seek them out in their native haunts&mdash;on
seashore and mesa, in deep, cool cañon, on dry and open
hill-slope, on mountain-top, in glacier meadow, by stream and
lake, in marsh and woodland, and to listen to the ofttimes
marvelous tales they have had to unfold. If they shall have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[ x]</a></span>
succeeded in making better known these children of Mother
Nature to her lovers and appreciators, and in arousing an
interest in them among those who have hitherto found the
technical difficulties of scientific botany insurmountable, they
will feel amply rewarded for their labors.</p>

<p>The present work does not claim by any means to be a
complete flora of the region treated. Our State is so new,
and many parts of it have as yet been so imperfectly explored,
that a comprehensive and exhaustive flora of it must be the
work of a future time, and will doubtless be undertaken by
some one when all the data have been procured. Such an
attempt, however, were it possible, is without the scope of the
present work.</p>

<p>California, with her wonderfully varied climate and topography,
has a flora correspondingly rich and varied, probably
not surpassed by any region of like area in the Northern
Hemisphere. Thus the author finds herself confronted with
an embarrassment of riches rather than with any lack of material;
and it has often been exceedingly difficult to exclude
some beautiful flower that seemed to have strong claims to
representation. She therefore craves beforehand the indulgence
of the reader, should he find some favorite missing.</p>

<p>In making a choice, she has been guided by the following
general principles, and selected, <i>first</i>&mdash;the flowers most general
in their distribution; <i>second</i>&mdash;those remarkable for their
beauty of form or color, their interesting structure, history, or
economic uses; <i>third</i>&mdash;those which are characteristically Californian.
At the same time, those which are too insignificant
in appearance to attract attention and those too difficult of
determination by the non-botanist have been omitted. Flowering
plants only have been included.</p>

<p>Many of our species extend northward into Oregon and
Washington. Thus, while this work is called "<span class="smcap">The Wild
Flowers of California</span>," it will in a certain measure apply
equally well to Oregon and Washington.</p>

<p>It has been the aim of the author to picture for the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[ xi]</a></span>
part the flowers peculiarly Californian, leaving Mrs. Dana's
charming book, "How to Know the Wild Flowers," to illustrate
those we possess in common with the Atlantic Slope, thus
making the works the complements one of the other.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dana has kindly permitted the author to use her plan
of arrangement&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> of grouping all the white flowers in one
section, the yellow in another, the pink in a third, and so on,
which, in the absence of a key, greatly facilitates the finding of
any given flower. The flowers of each section have been
arranged as nearly as possible according to their natural succession
in the seasons, with one or two exceptions.</p>

<p>Such confusion is rife in the nomenclature of Californian
plants, and the same plant is so often furnished with several
names,&mdash;and several plants sometimes with the same name,&mdash;that
the authority is in every instance quoted, in order to
make it perfectly clear what plant is meant by the name given.
Wherever allusion is made to the Spanish-Californians, the
Spanish-<i>speaking</i> Californians are meant, very few of whom
are Castilians at the present day, most of whom are of an admixture
of races.</p>

<p>The flower-cuts are all from pen-and-ink drawings by the
illustrator; and all but four are from her own original studies
from nature. These four, which it was impossible for her to
procure, have been adapted by her from other drawings, by
the aid of herbarium specimens. They include <i>Aphyllon fasciculatum</i>,
<i>Fremontia Californica</i>, <i>Hosackia gracilis</i>, and <i>Brodiæa
volubilis</i>. It has been impossible upon so small a page
to maintain a uniform relative size in the drawings, for which
reason the plant-descriptions in fine print should be consulted
for the size.</p>

<p>The author and the illustrator desire to make grateful acknowledgments
to many kind friends throughout the State
who have rendered them assistance in numerous ways. Their
gratitude is due in particular to Miss Alice Eastwood, of the
California Academy of Sciences, who, by her unfailing kindness
and encouragement, as well as by her personal assistance, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[ xii]</a></span>
rendered them invaluable aid. Also, to Mr. Carl Purdy, of
Ukiah, who from his wide experience, as a grower of our
native liliaceous plants, has a knowledge of them shared by
few or none, and who has generously placed at their disposal
the results of his observations. They also tender their thanks
to the Southern Pacific and the North Pacific Railways, who,
by their generous granting of reduced rates and passes, have
made possible a wider personal acquaintance with the flowers
than could have otherwise been enjoyed.</p>

<h2><a name="HOW_TO_USE_THE_BOOK" id="HOW_TO_USE_THE_BOOK"></a>HOW TO USE THE BOOK</h2>


<p>When gathering flowers with a view to ascertaining their
names with the help of the botany, the whole plant&mdash;root,
stem, leaves, flowers, buds, and fruit&mdash;should be secured, if
possible. This will avoid much uncertainty in the work.</p>

<p>The anthers are best seen in the unopened buds, and the
ovary in old flowers or those gone to seed. A cross-section of
the ovary will show the number of its cells.</p>

<p>The flowers should be sorted into colors, and each in turn looked for in
its own color-section. In arranging the flowers according to color, some
difficulty has been experienced, because the pink blends so gradually into
the purple, and the purple into white, etc., that it has been impossible
sometimes to say accurately to which section a flower rightly belongs. In
such a case search must be made in the other probable section. Sometimes
the same flower occurs in several colors, in which case it is usually put
into the section in whose color it most frequently occurs. In the Red
Section have been included flowers of a scarlet hue, not those of crimson
or magenta hues, as these have a tendency to merge into pink or purple.
Flowers of a greenish-white are usually put into the White Section, those
of more decided green into the Miscellaneous.</p>

<p>It is an excellent plan for the student to write a careful description
of his plant before beginning to look for it in the book;
commencing with the root, passing on to stem, leaves, inflorescence,
calyx, corolla, etc., taking the order of the technical
descriptions in the book. This will serve to do away with
that vacillating condition of mind which is often the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[ xx]</a></span>
reading a number of plant-descriptions before fixing firmly in
mind the characters of the specimen under consideration.</p>

<p>A magnifying-glass&mdash;or a small dissecting microscope and
a good Zeiss lens, if more careful work is to be done,&mdash;a
couple of dissecting needles, a pocket-knife, and a small three
or four-inch measure, having one of the inches divided into
lines, will be required for examining specimens.</p>

<p>It is also a good plan to make a note of the date and place
of collection of all plants, as it is often of great interest to know
these facts at some future time.</p>

<p>Plants are grouped into great orders, or families, which are
made up of a number of genera, each genus consisting of a
number of species. Every plant has two Latin names; the
first a generic name, answering to the last name of a person;
the second a specific name, answering to a person's given
name. The latter is usually descriptive of some quality or
character of the plant, the name of the place where found, or
of its discoverer, or of some person in whose honor it is
named. This dual name serves to clearly distinguish the
species from all others, especially when the name of the person
by whom the specific name was bestowed is added.</p>

<p>Each plant-family bears an English title, which is usually
the name of its best-known genus. Thus the order <i>Leguminosæ</i>
is known as the "Pea Family" because <i>Lathyrus</i>, or the
pea, is its best-known genus. In many instances the English
names borne by orders in the Eastern States have no significance
with us, as the type genus is not found in our flora. In
such cases we have given the name of the genus best known
among us, to which we have added the other; thus, "Baby-eyes
or Waterleaf Family."</p>

<p>Most of our plants have common English names, and the
same plant is often known by one name in one locality and by
another in another. Hence, while these names are often pretty
and apt, they cannot serve for the accurate identification of the
plant. For this we must consult its Latin name, by which it is
known all over the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[ xxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Wherever the terms used are not understood, reference
should be made to the "Explanation of Terms" or to the
Glossary.</p>

<p>For identification of species not found in the present work,
other books should be consulted. The two large volumes of
the botany of the Geological Survey of California are the most
complete of anything thus far published. In addition to these,
"The Synoptical Flora of North America," as far as published
(the <i>Gamopetalæ</i>, the <i>Compositæ</i>, and some orders of the <i>Polypetalæ</i>),
furnishes valuable aid. Professor E.L. Greene's
works, "The Botany of the Bay Region," "Pittonia," and
"Flora Franciscana," furnish excellent plant-descriptions for
the more advanced botanist. The author's technical descriptions
have in every instance been verified by comparison with
one or more of the above works.</p>

<p>Miss Eastwood's little volume, recently published as Part
Second of "Bergen's Elements of Botany," (and also issued
in separate form), is recommended for use in connection with
the present work, as it embodies in compact form a general
view of the method of classification of plants, showing their
places in the plant-world and their relations to one another. It
also contains very clear descriptions of plant-families. To the
student who becomes interested in knowing more about the
structure of plants, Gray's "Structural Botany" will prove
useful; and the large work of Oliver and Kerner (translated
from the German) will prove a fascinating book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[ xxii]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="EXPLANATION_OF_TERMS" id="EXPLANATION_OF_TERMS"></a>EXPLANATION OF TERMS</h2>

<blockquote><p>[The following simple definitions of the more common terms used have been mostly
taken or adapted from the works of Asa Gray and others, and will prove useful to those
unacquainted with botany, or to those whose memories require refreshing.]</p></blockquote>


<h3>ROOTS</h3>

<p>The <b>root</b> is that portion of the plant which grows downward,
fixing it to the soil, and absorbing nourishment from
the latter. True roots produce nothing but root-branches or
rootlets.</p>

<p>Simple or unbranched roots are named according to their
shapes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>conical</i>, when like the carrot;</p>

<p><i>napiform</i>, when like the turnip;</p>

<p><i>fusiform</i>, when like the long radish.</p></blockquote>

<p>Multiple, or branched, roots may be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>fascicled</i>, or bunched, as in the dahlia;</p>

<p><i>tubercular</i>, when furnished with small tubers;</p>

<p><i>fibrous</i>, when threadlike.</p></blockquote>


<h3>STEMS</h3>

<p>The <b>stem</b> is the ascending axis of the plant, which usually
bears the leaves, flowers, and fruit. The points on the stem to
which the leaves are fastened are called the <b>nodes</b>; and the
portions of stem between the nodes are called the <b>internodes</b>.
The angle formed by the upper side of the leaf and the stem is
called the <b>axil</b>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[ xxiii]</a></span></p>

<p>Stems aboveground are classed as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>erect</i>, when growing upright;</p>

<p><i>procumbent</i>, when lying on the ground without rooting;</p>

<p><i>decumbent</i>, when lying on the ground with the tip
ascending;</p>

<p><i>diffuse</i>, when loosely spreading;</p>

<p><i>creeping</i>, when growing on the ground and rooting.</p></blockquote>

<p>Stems underground are classed as <b>rhizomes</b> (or <b>rootstocks</b>)
<b>tubers</b>, <b>corms</b>, and <b>bulbs</b>, the forms passing into one another
by gradations.</p>

<blockquote><p>A <b>rhizome</b>, or <b>rootstock</b>, is a horizontal underground
stem. It is sometimes thick, fleshy, or woody, as in
the iris;</p>

<p>a <b>tuber</b> is a short, much thickened rootstock, having
eyes or buds of which the potato is an example;</p>

<p>a <b>corm</b> is a depressed and rounded, solid rootstock; it
may be called a solid bulb; the garden cyclamen is an
example;</p>

<p>a <b>bulb</b> is a leaf-bud, commonly underground, with fleshy
scales or coats; the lily is an example.</p></blockquote>


<h3>LEAVES</h3>

<p><b>Leaves</b> are the green expansions borne by the stem, out-spread
in the air and light, in which assimilation is carried on.
They may be said to be the stomachs of the plant. A typical
leaf consists of three parts&mdash;the <b>blade</b>, the <b>foot-stalk</b> (or <b>petiole</b>),
and a pair of <b>stipules</b>. Yet any one of these parts may
be absent.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <b>blade</b> is the expanded portion of the leaf and the
part to which the word <i>leaf</i>, in its commonest sense,
is applied;</p>

<p>the <b>stipules</b> are small, usually leaflike bodies borne at
the base of the petiole, usually one on either side;</p>

<p>the <b>petiole</b> is the stalk of the leaf.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[ xxiv]</a></span></p>

<p><b>Leaves</b> are <b>simple</b>, when having but one blade; <b>compound</b>,
when having more than one, when each blade is called a <b>leaflet</b>.</p>

<p>Compound leaves are said to be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>pinnate</i>, when the leaflets are arranged along the sides of
a petiole, or rather of its prolongation, the rachis;</p>

<p><i>abruptly pinnate</i>, with an even number of leaflets;</p>

<p><i>odd-pinnate</i>, with an odd leaflet at the end;</p>

<p><i>palmate</i>, or <i>digitate</i>, when the leaflets all diverge from the
summit of the petiole, like the fingers of a hand.</p></blockquote>


<h3>VENATION</h3>

<p>The venation, or veining, of leaves relates to the mode in
which the woody tissue, in the form of ribs, veins, etc., is distributed
in the cellular tissue.</p>

<p>There are two principle modes&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>the <i>parallel-veined</i>, of which the iris is an example;</p>

<p>the <i>reticulated-veined</i>, or <i>netted-veined</i>, of which the Elm
is an example.</p></blockquote>

<p>Small veins are called <b>veinlets</b>.</p>


<h3>FORM</h3>

<p>As to general form, or outline, leaves are:&mdash;</p>

<p>Those broadest in the middle&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>peltate</i>, or shield-shaped, when rounded, with the stem
attached to the center, or near it&mdash;as in the garden
nasturtium;</p>

<p><i>orbicular</i>, when circular in outline, or nearly so;</p>

<p><i>oval</i>, when having a flowing outline, with the breadth
considerably more than half the length, and both
ends alike;</p>

<p><i>elliptical</i>, when having a flowing outline, twice or thrice
as long as broad, and both ends alike;</p>

<p><i>oblong</i>, when nearly twice or thrice as long as broad;</p>

<p><i>linear</i>, when narrow, several times longer than wide,
and of about the same width throughout;</p>

<p><i>acerose</i>, when needle-shaped&mdash;like the Pine.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[ xxv]</a></span></p>

<p>Those broadest at the base&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>deltoid</i>, when having the triangular shape of the Greek
letter <i>delta</i>;</p>

<p><i>ovate</i>, when having an outline like the section of a
hen's-egg, the broader end downward;</p>

<p><i>lanceolate</i>, or lance-shaped, when several times longer
than broad, and tapering upward, or both upward
and downward;</p>

<p><i>subulate</i>, when shaped like an awl;</p>

<p><i>cordate</i>, when ovate, with a heart-shaped base;</p>

<p><i>reniform</i>, when like the last, only rounder and broader
than long;</p>

<p><i>auriculate</i>, when having a pair of small blunt projections,
or ears, at the base;</p>

<p><i>sagittate</i>, or arrow-shaped, when those ears are acute
and turned downward, the body of the leaf tapering
upward;</p>

<p><i>hastate</i>, or halberd-shaped, when the ears or lobes point
outward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those broadest at the apex&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>obovate</i>, when inversely ovate;</p>

<p><i>oblanceolate</i>, when inversely lanceolate;</p>

<p><i>spatulate</i>, when rounded above, and long and narrow
below, like a druggist's spatula;</p>

<p><i>cuneate</i>, or wedge-shaped, when broad above, tapering
by straight lines to an acute base;</p>

<p><i>obcordate</i>, when inversely cordate.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sometimes no one of the above terms will describe a leaf,
and it becomes necessary to combine two of them; as, <i>linear-spatulate</i>,
<i>ovate-lanceolate</i>, etc.</p>


<h3>THE APEX</h3>

<p>Leaves are classified according to their apices; as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>emarginate</i>, when having a decided terminal notch;</p>

<p><i>truncate</i>, when abruptly cut off;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[ xxvi]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>obtuse</i>, when ending in a blunt or roundish extremity;</p>

<p><i>acute</i>, when ending in an acute angle, without special
tapering;</p>

<p><i>acuminate</i>, when tapering into a narrow, more or less
prolonged end;</p>

<p><i>mucronate</i>, when abruptly tipped with a small, short point.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE MARGIN</h3>

<p>Leaves are classified according to their margins; as&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>entire</i>, when the margin is completely filled out to an
even line;</p>

<p><i>repand</i>, or <i>undulate</i>, when the margin is a wavy line;</p>

<p><i>dentate</i>, or <i>toothed</i>, when the teeth point outward;</p>

<p><i>crenate</i>, or <i>scalloped</i>, when dentate, with the teeth
rounded;</p>

<p><i>serrate</i>, when having small sharp teeth directed forward;</p>

<p><i>incised</i>, when cut by sharp and irregular incisions more
or less deeply;</p>

<p><i>lobed</i>, when cut not more than half-way to the midrib,
and the divisions or their angles are rounded;</p>

<p><i>cleft</i>, when cut half-way down or more, and the lobes or
sinuses are narrow or acute;</p>

<p><i>parted</i>, when the cutting reaches almost but not quite to
the midrib;</p>

<p><i>divided</i>, when the blade is cut into distinct parts, thus
making the leaf compound.</p></blockquote>

<p>All these terms may be modified by the words <i>pinnate</i> or
<i>palmate</i>; thus&mdash;<i>pinnately parted</i>, <i>pinnately divided</i>, <i>palmately
parted</i>, <i>palmately divided</i>, etc.; also by the adjectives <i>once</i>,
<i>twice</i>, <i>thrice</i>, etc.</p>


<h3>TEXTURE</h3>

<p>Leaves vary as to texture, and may be&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>coriaceous</i>, or leathery;</p>

<p><i>succulent</i>, or juicy;</p>

<p><i>scarious</i>, or dry and thin;</p>

<p><i>fleshy</i>, or thick;</p>

<p><i>herbaceous</i>, or thin.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[ xxvii]</a></span></p>


<h3>ARRANGEMENT</h3>

<p>According to their arrangement on the stem, leaves are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>alternate</i>, when distributed singly at different heights on
the stem;</p>

<p><i>opposite</i>, when two stand opposite each other at the
nodes;</p>

<p><i>whorled</i>, when more than two are borne at a node, equidistant
in a circle around the stem.</p></blockquote>


<h3>INFLORESCENCE</h3>

<p><b>Inflorescence</b> is a term commonly applied to the mode of
flowering&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> to the arrangement of blossoms on the stem
and their relative positions to one another.</p>

<blockquote><p>A <b>peduncle</b> is the stem of a solitary flower, or the main
stem of a flower-cluster;</p>

<p>a <b>scape</b> is a peduncle growing from the ground;</p>

<p>a <b>pedicel</b> is the stem of each flower in a cluster;</p>

<p>a <b>bract</b> is a small floral leaf;</p>

<p>an <b>involucre</b> is a collection of bracts around a flower-cluster
or around a single flower.</p></blockquote>

<p>Flowers may be solitary or clustered.</p>

<p>Solitary flowers or flower-clusters are&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>terminal</i>, when borne at the summit of the stem;</p>

<p><i>axillary</i>, when borne in the axils of the leaves.</p></blockquote>

<p>A flower-cluster is called&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>a <b>raceme</b>, when the flowers are arranged along the axis
upon pedicels nearly equal in length;</p>

<p>a <b>corymb</b>, when the flowers are arranged as in the raceme,
with the lower pedicels elongated, making the cluster
flat-topped;</p>

<p>an <b>umbel</b>, when the pedicels arise from the same point,
like the rays of an umbrella, and the cluster is flat-topped;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[ xxviii]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>a <b>panicle</b>, when compound, irregularly made up of a
number of racemes;</p>

<p>a <b>spike</b>, when like a raceme, the flowers being without
pedicels;</p>

<p>a <b>spadix</b>, when it is a fleshy spike, generally enveloped
by a large bract, called a <b>spathe</b>, as in the calla-lily;</p>

<p>an <b>ament</b>, or <b>catkin</b>, when it is a pendent spike, with
scaly bracts, like the Willow;</p>

<p>a <b>head</b>, when it is a shortened spike, with a globular form;</p>

<p>a <b>cyme</b>, when it is branched and flat-topped, usually
compound, with the older flowers in the center of each
simple cluster.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE INDIVIDUAL FLOWER</h3>

<p>A <b>complete flower</b> consists of <b>stamens</b> and <b>pistils</b> (the
organs of reproduction), and <b>calyx</b> and <b>corolla</b> (the floral
envelops which protect the stamens and pistils). But any
one of these organs may be absent.</p>

<blockquote><p>The <b>calyx</b> is the outer floral envelop, which is more
often green, though it is sometimes colored. It may
consist of a number of separate parts, called <b>sepals</b>, or
these may be more or less united.</p>

<p>The <b>corolla</b> is the inner floral envelop. It is usually
colored, and forms the most beautiful feature of the
flower, and plays an important part in attracting
insects to it, which may carry on the work of fertilization.
It may consist of a number of separate parts,
called <b>petals</b>, or these may be more or less united,
in which case the corolla is said to be <i>gamopetalous</i>.
When the calyx and corolla are much alike, and seem
like one floral circle, this is referred to as a <b>perianth</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>stamens</b> and <b>pistils</b> are called the <b>essential organs</b>
of a flower, because they are necessary to the maturing
of the fruit.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[ xxix]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><b>Perfect flowers</b> have both sets of essential organs.</p>

<p><b>Imperfect flowers</b> have but one set of essential organs.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><i>Staminate</i> (or male) <i>flowers</i> have only stamens;</p>

<p><i>Pistillate</i> (or female) <i>flowers</i> have only pistils.</p>

<p><i>Neutral flowers</i> have neither.</p></blockquote>


<h3>THE STAMEN</h3>

<p>The <b>stamen</b> consists of two parts&mdash;the <b>filament</b> and the
<b>anther</b>. The filament is the stalk of the stamen. The anther
is the little case holding the <b>pollen</b>, or powdery substance,
which, falling upon the stigma, is conducted downward into
the ovary, where it quickens the ovules into life. The anther
normally consists of two cells, which more often open lengthwise
for the discharge of the pollen, though they sometimes
open by terminal pores or chinks, or by uplifting lids.</p>

<p>Stamens sometimes undergo a morphological change, taking
the form of scales or other bodies (as is the case in many
of our <i>Brodiæas</i>), when they are called <b>staminodia</b>.</p>


<h3>THE PISTIL</h3>

<p>The <b>pistil</b> is the organ occupying the center of the flower.
It consists of three parts&mdash;the <b>ovary</b>, or the enlarged part
below, consisting of one or more cells or cavities, and containing
the ovules, or unfertilized seed; the <b>style</b>, or the stem
which upholds the stigma; the <b>stigma</b>, or the roughened portion
which receives the pollen.</p>

<p>The pistil is <i>simple</i>, when it has but one ovary, style,
stigma, etc.; <i>compound</i>, if any one of these is duplicated.</p>


<h3>THE FRUIT</h3>

<p>The <b>fruit</b> is the ripened ovary. After the ovules have been
fertilized, the ovary is called a <b>pericarp</b>. Fruits may be either
<i>fleshy</i> or <i>dry</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[ xxx]</a></span></p>

<p>The following are some of the principal kinds of dry fruits:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A <b>capsule</b> is a dry, dehiscent (splitting) fruit, composed
of more than one carpel or division;</p>

<p>an <b>akene</b> is a small, dry, hard, one-celled, one-seeded
indehiscent fruit;</p>

<p>a <b>follicle</b> is a pod formed from a single pistil, dehiscing
along the ventral suture only;</p>

<p>a <b>legume</b> is a simple pericarp, opening by both seams.</p>

<p>a <b>samara</b> is a dry, indehiscent fruit, having a wing.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following are some of the principal kinds of fleshy
fruits:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>A <b>pome</b> is a fruit like an apple or pear;</p>

<p>the <b>pepo</b>, or <b>gourd</b>, fruit is like that of the melon, squash,
etc.;</p>

<p>the <b>drupe</b> is like that of the cherry, plum, and peach;</p>

<p>the <b>berry</b> is like that of the grape, currant, and tomato.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Aggregate fruits</b> are those in which a cluster of carpels,
all of one flower, are crowded upon the receptacle into one
mass; as in the raspberry and blackberry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[ xxxi]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>[To avoid too long technical descriptions in the body of the work, a few of the
more important plant families and genera have been inserted below, to which
reference has been made in the technical descriptions.]</p></blockquote>


<h3>FAMILIES</h3>

<p class="cen"><b>Cruciferæ.</b> Mustard Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs with pungent, watery juice. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; without
stipules; entire or divided. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Generally in racemes. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Four.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; usually with narrowed base or claw; the blades
spreading to form a cross. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; two of them shorter than
the other four. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled; rarely one-celled. Style undivided,
or none. Stigma entire or two-lobed. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A silique&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> a capsule,
in which the walls separate upward away from a central partition.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Mustard family is a very large one, comprising over a
hundred and seventy genera, and containing between one and
two thousand species. It is widely distributed over all parts
of the world, but is most abundantly represented in the cooler
or temperate regions. It furnishes us with many useful plants;
such as the mustard, horseradish, radish, cabbage, turnip, cauliflower,
etc.</p>

<p>The genera of this order are very closely allied, and very
difficult of discrimination. The fruit, as well as the flower, is
necessary in the study of any given species.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Leguminosæ.</b> Pea Family.</p>

<p>The order <i>Leguminosæ</i> is divided into three well-marked
sub-orders&mdash;the Pea family proper, the Brasiletto family, and
the Mimosa family. But as all our genera, save <i>Cercis</i>, fall
under the first, we shall describe that only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[ xxxii]</a></span></p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap"><b>Papilionaceæ</b>.</span> Pea Family proper.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs, shrubs, or trees. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually alternate; compound;
with stipules; the latter sometimes transformed into thorns or tendrils.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Seldom solitary; usually in spikes, racemes or umbels.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed; often bilabiate. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Irregular; of five
petals; <i>papilionaceous</i>&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the two lower petals more or less coherent,
forming the <i>keel</i>; the two lateral ones often adherent to the keel,
called the <i>wings</i>; the upper petal called the <i>standard</i> or <i>banner</i>. Stamens
and pistil inclosed in the keel. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten; their filaments
either coherent into a tube surrounding the pistil; or nine of them
united into a sheath, open above, the tenth lying in front of the cleft;
or rarely all distinct. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Superior; one-celled. <i>Style.</i>&mdash;Simple
and incurved. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Simple. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A two-valved pod, of
which the garden pea is typical.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Pea family, including its three sub-orders, is one of the
most important plant-families known. It is distributed over
almost the entire world, and furnishes some of the most valuable
products to man. The Judas-tree, the numerous acacias,
and the sweet pea, are well known in our gardens; while
among our most valuable vegetables are the bean, the pea, and
the lentil. The clover and alfalfa are extremely important
forage plants.</p>

<p>The order furnishes several important timber-trees, in different
parts of the world, such as the Rosewood, the Laburnum,
and the Locust; and yields numerous products of economic
importance, such as licorice, senna, gum Senegal, gum Arabic,
gum tragacanth, balsam of copaiba, balsam of Tolu, indigo,
logwood, red sandalwood, etc.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Compositæ.</b> Composite Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs, rarely shrubs. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually alternate; without stipules.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In a close head on a common <i>receptacle</i>, surrounded by an
<i>involucre</i>, whose divisions are called <i>scales</i> or <i>bracts</i>. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Adnate
to the one-celled ovary; its limb (called a <i>pappus</i>) crowning
its summit in the form of bristles, awns, scales, teeth, etc.; or cup-shaped;
or else entirely absent. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Either strap-shaped or
tubular; in the latter chiefly five-lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five (rarely four);
on the corolla; their anthers united in a tube. <i>Style.</i>&mdash;Two-cleft at the
apex. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;An akene. Flowers with strap-shaped corollas are
called <i>ray flowers</i> or <i>rays</i>. The <i>tubular flowers</i> compose the disk.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Composite family is the largest of all plant-families,
numbering twelve thousand species and upward, and is widely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[ xxxiii]</a></span>
distributed over the world. In the cooler parts of the world
the plants are mostly herbaceous, but toward the tropics they
gradually become shrubs, and even trees. In North America
they comprise about one sixth of all the flowering plants.</p>

<p>For so large a family there are comparatively few useful
plants found in it. Among the products of the order, may be
mentioned chicory, lettuce, the artichoke, the vegetable oyster,
arnica, chamomile-flowers, wormwood, absinth, elecampane,
coltsfoot, taraxacum, oil of tansy, etc. But our gardens owe
to this family innumerable beautiful and showy plants such
as the China aster, the chrysanthemum, the cosmos, zinnia,
dahlia, ageratum, gaillardia, coreopsis, sunflower, etc., etc.</p>

<p>The plants of this family are quickly recognized by the
flowers being always borne in a head and surrounded by an
involucre, and presenting the appearance of a single flower.
The heads are sometimes made up entirely of one kind of
flower. The dandelion and the chicory are examples of a head
made up entirely of ray-flowers, while the thistle consists of tubular
flowers only. The more common arrangement, however, is
the mixed one, comprising both tubular disk-flowers and strap-shaped
rays, as in the daisy. The seeds are usually furnished
with silken down or a delicate parachute to waft them abroad.</p>

<p>The identification of the flowers of this order is a very difficult
matter, even for experienced botanists.</p>

<p class="cen"><b>Labiatæ.</b> Mint Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs with square stems. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; usually aromatic.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Axillary, or often in whorls or heads. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate
(rarely regular). <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four (or only two). <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Deeply
four-lobed; becoming four seedlike nutlets. Style single; arising from
the midst of the lobes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The plants of this order are easily recognized by the traits in
the above description. But some of these traits are shared by the
plants of the Figwort family, which have also the bilabiate corolla.
The distinguishing character, however, is always to be found in
the <i>four-lobed ovary</i> for the Figworts have a two-celled ovary.</p>

<p>This order is a large one; and there are no noxious or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[ xxxiv]</a></span>
poisonous plants to be found in it. On the contrary, it comprises
many useful plants, too well known almost to need
enumeration&mdash;such as the lavender, peppermint, sage, horehound,
thyme, spearmint, <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'horse-mint'">horsemint</ins>, pennyroyal, etc.</p>


<h3>GENERA</h3>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Ceanothus</span>, L. Buckthorn Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or small trees, sometimes spinescent. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite
or alternate; petioled; variously toothed or entire. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Blue or
white; small, usually not more than two or three lines across; borne in
showy thyrsoid or cymose clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Petaloid; with short tube
and five-cleft border, the lobes acute and connivent. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five;
long-clawed; hooded; inserted on the calyx-tube. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
opposite the petals; long exserted. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-lobed; three-celled.
Style short; three-cleft. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Dry; consisting of three
dehiscent nutlets; sometimes crested.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Ceanothus</i> is mainly a Western one. Of its
thirty or more species, two thirds are found in the region
between the Rocky Mountains and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>In California we have about twenty species; and these all
hybridize to such an extent, that often the determination of any
given species is a very difficult matter. The genus reaches its
culmination in the mountains of Santa Cruz County, where
there are many beautiful species. Many of the species are
commonly known as "California lilac."</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Lupinus</span>, Catullus. Pea Family.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Palmately divided, with from one to sixteen leaflets; stipules
adnate; seldom conspicuous. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Entire; sessile. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In
terminal racemes, whorled or scattered. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply bilabiate;
upper lip notched; lower usually entire, or occasionally three-toothed
or cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Papilionaceous. <i>Standard.</i>&mdash;Broad, with
sides reflexed. <i>Wings.</i>&mdash;Falcate; oblong; commonly slightly united
at the tip in front of and inclosing the falcate, usually slender, pointed
keel. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;With their filaments united in a tube; of two forms;
five with longer and basifixed anthers; the alternate five with shorter
and versatile ones. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Compressed; straight; two-valved. Style
slender. Stigma bearded.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Lupines are mostly plants of Western America. In
fact, they are so abundant between the Rocky Mountains and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[ xxxv]</a></span>
the Pacific Ocean that that territory is known among botanists
as the "Lupine Region."</p>

<p>The species, which are very numerous, are difficult of determination,
requiring very long technical descriptions, which cannot
be given in a work like the present. For this reason we
have been able to give but a few of the more easily recognized.</p>

<p>We have in California upwards of forty species. They are
of little economic importance, although one or two species
have been found very useful in the reclaiming of sand-dunes.
Several species have been cultivated for ornament. The leaves
are often beautiful and the flower-clusters showy.</p>

<p>The generic name is supposed to come from the Latin
<i>lupinus</i>, a <i>wolf</i>, and to have been given because of the voracity
evinced by the species in exhausting the soil.</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Astragalus</span>, Tourn. Pea Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs, or sometimes plants woody at base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
with stipules; unequally pinnate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rather small; chiefly in
simple axillary spikes or racemes, upon a commonly elongated peduncle;
papilionaceous. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla</i> and its slender-clawed
petals usually narrow. Keel not pointed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine
united; one free. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled; sometimes apparently two-celled.
<i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Very various; commonly inflated. <i>Seeds.</i>&mdash;Few to
many on slender stalks; generally small for the size of the pod.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Astragalus</i> is a very large one, comprising many
species in most parts of the world, save Australia and South
Africa. About two hundred species are native of North
America, most of which are found in the region west of the
Mississippi River. Of these several are known as "loco-weed,"
and are poisonous to sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>Very few species of this genus have any economic value.
<i>A. gummifer</i> and some other similar species of Western Asia,
low, spiny shrubs, yield the gum tragacanth of commerce.</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">&#338;nothera</span>, L. Evening-Primrose Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs, or plants sometimes woody at the base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Axillary or in spikes or racemes. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;More
or less prolonged above the ovary with four reflexed segments.</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[ xxxvi]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; obcordate to obovate; sessile; yellow to white, often
tinged with red or turning red in fading. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight; equal; or
those opposite the petals shorter. Anthers perfect; two-celled; versatile.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-celled; many ovuled. Style filiform. Stigma
four-lobed or capitate. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A capsule with the seeds in one or
two rows in each cell.</p></blockquote>

<p>The name <i>&#338;nothera</i> is from two Greek words, meaning
<i>wine</i> and <i>a hunt</i>, or <i>pursuit</i>. Mr. Gray tells us that it was
given in ancient times to some plant whose roots were eaten
to provoke a relish for wine.</p>

<p>This is a large genus, containing a hundred or more
species, which are mostly confined to America, about a quarter
of them being Californian. Many of them are very beautiful
and have long been favorites in gardens. The flowers are
yellow or white, and are commonly designated as "evening
primroses," as many of them open upon the edge of evening.</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Godetia</span>, Spach. Evening-Primrose Family.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Godetia</i> is closely allied to that of <i>&#338;nothera</i>;
but is distinguished from the latter in several points. Its
flowers are purple, lilac, or rose-colored&mdash;never yellow; the
anthers are basifixed&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> fixed by their bases&mdash;not versatile;
and the stigma, instead of being capitate, has four linear
lobes.</p>

<p>The plants of this genus were formerly included under
<i>&#338;nothera</i>; but it has been thought best to put them into a
separate genus, which has been named for a Dr. Godet.</p>

<p>There are numerous species, many of them very beautiful
and showy. They vary a great deal under different conditions
and in different seasons, and are not well understood by botanists
as yet.</p>

<p>The genus is confined to the western coast of North America,
and is most largely represented in California.</p>

<p>The species flower mostly in late spring and early summer,
which has given rise to the pretty name of "farewell to spring"
for the plants of this genus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[ xxxvii]</a></span></p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Gilia</span>, Renz. and Pav. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs or plants somewhat shrubby at base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite or
alternate; simple or compound; without stipules. Many species with
showy flowers. All the parts of the flower five, except the pistil, which
has a three-celled ovary and a three-lobed style. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Imbricated
in the bud. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Regular; funnel-form, salver-form, or sometimes
short campanulate or rotate; convolute in the bud. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
on the corolla alternate with its lobes; distinct. Filaments mostly
slender; sometimes unequal in length; not bearded at base.</p></blockquote>

<p>This genus was named in honor of Philip Gil, a Spanish
botanist. In America the name is pronounced <i>jil'i-a</i>, though
according to the rules of the Spanish language <i>he'li-a</i> would
be the correct pronunciation.</p>

<p>This is a comparatively large genus, comprising about a
hundred species, most of which are native to the western parts
of the United States. The flowers are often showy and beautiful,
and some of them closely resemble the phloxes. A number
are cultivated under the botanical name of <i>Ipomopsis</i> or
<i>Leptosiphon</i>.</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Phacelia</span>, Juss. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Herbs, mostly branched from the base and hairy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;

without appendages. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;From almost rotate to narrowly
funnel-form; five-lobed; with ten vertical plates or scales at the

<p>The name <i>Phacelia</i> is from a Greek word signifying a <i>fascicle</i>,
or <i>bunch</i>, and refers to the fascicled or clustered flower-racemes.</p>

<p>This genus is closely allied to <i>Nemophila</i>, but differs from
it in several points. The calyx is not furnished with appendages
at the sinuses; the corolla is imbricated in the bud&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the lobes overlap one another in the manner of bricks in
a wall,&mdash;and is not convolute, or rolled up, as in <i>Nemophila</i>.</p>

<p>This is mainly a North American genus, having about fifty
species, about thirty of which are Californian. Many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[ xxxviii]</a></span>
species have beautiful and showy flowers, and are cultivated in
gardens. The blossoms are blue, violet, purple, or white, but
never yellow (save sometimes in the tube or throat).</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Mimulus</span>, L. Figwort Family.</p>

sometimes becoming racemose by the diminution of the upper
leaves to bracts. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Tubular or campanulate; mostly five-angled
and five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Funnel-form; bilabiate; the upper lip erect,
two-lobed; the lower three-lobed; a pair of ridges, either bearded or
naked, running down the lower side of the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four.
Anthers often near together in pairs, with divergent cells. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Superior;
two-celled. Style filiform. Stigma two-lipped, with the lips
commonly dilated and petaloid.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Mimulus</i> is so named from the shape of the
corolla, which is supposed to resemble the gaping countenance
of an ape. It comprises forty or fifty species, and affords us
some of our most beautiful flowers. The greater number of
species and the handsomest are Pacific, and several of our
Californian species are especially prized in cultivation.</p>

<p>The plants of the genus are all known as "monkey-flowers."
They exhibit an interesting character in the structure
and movements of the stigma. It is usually composed of
two somewhat expanded lips. These are extremely sensitive,
and when touched, or when pollen has been received by them,
they close quite rapidly.</p>

<p class="cen"><span class="smcap">Orthocarpus</span>, Nutt. Figwort Family.</p>

<blockquote><p>Low herbs; almost all annuals. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mainly alternate; sessile;
often cut into from three to five filiform divisions; the upper passing
into the bracts of the dense spike and usually colored, as are the calyx-lobes.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Short-tubular or oblong-campanulate; evenly four-cleft,
or sometimes cleft before and behind and the divisions again cleft.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular; the upper lip, or galea, little or not at all longer
than the lower; small in comparison with the large, inflated, one- to
three-saccate lower one, which usually bears more or less conspicuous
teeth. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; inclosed in the upper lip. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
Style long. Stigma capitate. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A capsule.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Orthocarpus</i> is mainly Californian, comprising
within our borders something less than twenty species. Most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[ xxxix]</a></span>
of them are to be found from San Francisco northward and
in the mountains.</p>

<p>They are closely related to the <i>Castilleias</i>, and resemble
them closely in habit. The difference between the two genera
lies in the relative sizes of the upper and lower lips of the
corolla. In <i>Castilleia</i> the upper lip is the larger and more
prominent; while in <i>Orthocarpus</i> the lower is much more conspicuous,
often consisting of three inflated sacs.</p>

<p>The species are quite difficult of determination.</p>

of this genus.</p>

rarely yellow; in raceme-like panicles. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With
a conspicuous and mostly elongated or ventricose tube; the
throat swelling out on the lower if on either side; the limb more or less

filament only. Anther cells mostly united or running together at the
summit. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style long. Stigma entire.</p></blockquote>

<p>The name <i>Pentstemon</i> is from two Greek words, signifying
<i>five</i> and <i>stamen</i>. It was bestowed upon this genus because the
fifth stamen is present, though sterile.</p>

<p>The genus is a large one, comprising seventy species, most
of which are North American, though a few are Mexican. It
is most abundantly represented in the Pacific States and the
States west of the Mississippi. California has over twenty
species, many of them very beautiful, a number of them being
in cultivation.</p>

<p>"Beard-tongue" is the common English name for the plants
of this genus.</p>

<p>From so many charming species it has been very difficult to
select; and if the reader finds some beautiful flower of this

flowers, usually large and handsome, followed by
erect capsules.</p>

<p>They have a few narrow, grasslike, radical leaves, which
have usually dried away by the time of flowering, which is in
early summer, after the ground has become dry and hard.
These inhabit our dry, open hillsides and grassy slopes, loving

thirty different known forms, and others are constantly being
discovered.</p>

<p>They have a tendency to hybridize, and the various forms
sport and vary, and run into one another in such a wonderful
manner that the exact determination of all the species is an
impossible task to all but a few experts&mdash;and even they are not
certain about them all yet. We have given only a few of the

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTORY" id="INTRODUCTORY"></a>INTRODUCTORY</h2>


<p>Situated on the western verge of the continent, so far
removed from the other parts of our country, not only by great
distance, but by those mighty natural barriers that traverse the
continent from north to south, California is eminently individual
in her natural features. Stretching through nine and one half
degrees of latitude, with a sea-coast of seven hundred miles,
and several ranges of fine and lofty mountains, there is probably
not another State in the Union that has so wonderful a
diversity of climate and vegetation. Her shores, bathed by
the warm Japan Current, or Ku-ro Si-wa, which is deflected
southward from Alaska, are many degrees warmer than their
latitude alone would warrant.</p>

<p>Her general topography is simple and readily understood.
The Sierra Nevada, or "snowy range," upon the eastern boundary,
with its granite summits and its shoulders clothed with
successive belts of majestic coniferous forests, with an occasional
snow-peak towering above the range, forms the eastern wall of
the great Central Valley, which is inclosed upon the west by
the Coast Range, less in height than the Sierra, but equally
beautiful, less forbidding, more companionable. The great
Central Valley, four hundred and fifty miles long, is drained
by two rivers, which meet in its center and break through the
Coast Range, delivering their waters to the ocean through the
Golden Gate. The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers receive
many important tributaries from the east, fed by the melting
snows of the Sierras, and flow through one of the most fertile
regions of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[ xliii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sierras may be divided into five different belts, of varying
altitudes along the length of the range, beginning with the
foothill region, which may be termed the chaparral region.
This is succeeded by the yellow-pine belt, above which is the
sugar-pine, or upper forest, belt, which is in turn succeeded by
the sub-alpine, while the alpine dominates all.</p>

<p>The Coast Range is channeled on both sides by many beautiful
wooded cañons, affording homes for some of our loveliest
flowers. Mr. Purdy writes of it: This "is not a continuous
range, but a broken mass of parallel ridges from forty to seventy
miles wide, with many other chains transverse to the general
trend of the range, and inclosing numerous valleys, large
and small, of widely different altitudes. In the Coast Range
there is no warm belt, but isolated warm spots. Climate here
can only be ascertained by experience. The geological formation
of the ranges and the character of soils constantly vary,
and often widely at short intervals. Hence the flora of this
region is particularly interesting. It is hardly probable there
is a more captivating field for the botanist in the world."</p>

<p>In the north and the south the two great ranges meet in
some of the noblest snow-peaks on the continent. Below their
southern junction, to the eastward, lies an arid desert region,
and above their northern junction extends a dry and elevated
plateau to the northeast. Thus there arises a great diversity
of natural condition. As all living organisms are greatly
influenced by their environment, the flora naturally distributes
itself along the lines of climatic variation. Thus we have
alpine species on the snowy heights of the Sierras, and sub-alpine
forms luxuriating in the meadows fed from their snows;
inland species in the Central Valley, and following some distance
up its eastern and western walls; the leathery and hardy
forms of the wind-swept coast; the curious prickly races of
arid regions; delicate lovers of the cool and shaded brook;
dwellers in marshes and on lake borders; denizens of dry, rocky
hill-slopes, exposed to the glare of the sun; and inhabiters of
shaded woods. It may be said that the most characteristically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[ xliv]</a></span>
Western plants of our flora are to be found in the Central Valley,
in the lower belts of the Sierras, and in the valleys of the
Coast Range, many of which extend beyond our borders, both
northward and southward. Many of our alpine species are
common to the East, and our maritime flora is of necessity
somewhat cosmopolitan, containing many introduced species
from various parts of the world.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>The climate of California is divided into two seasons&mdash;the
wet and the dry,&mdash;the former extending from October to May,
the latter occupying the remaining months of the year. And
this climatic division coincides almost exactly with the area of
the State. Of course, these dates are not absolute, as showers
may occur beyond their limits.</p>

<p>It will be readily seen that the rainy season, or the winter,
so-called, is the growing time of our year&mdash;the time when the
earth brings forth every plant in his kind. On the other hand,
the summer is the time of rest. Most of the plant-life having
germinated after the first moisture of the fall, grows luxuriantly
during the showery months of winter, blossoms lavishly in the
balmy sunshine of early springtime, produces seed in abundance
by early summer, and is then ready for its annual rest.
Instead of shrouding the earth in snow during our period of
plant-rest, as she does in more rigorous climes, Nature gently
spreads over hill and valley a soft mantle of brown.</p>

<p>When the first shrill notes of the cicada are heard in late
spring, we awake to a sudden realization that summer is at
hand, and, looking about us, we see that the flowers have
nearly all vanished; hill and valley no longer glow with great
masses of color; only a few straggling species of the early summer
remain; but they too are soon gone, and soft browns and
straw-colors prevail everywhere. It is then that the deep, rich
greens of our symmetrically rounded Live-Oaks, so characteristic
of this region, show in fine contrast against this delicate
background, forming a picture that every Californian dearly
loves; the Madroño and the Laurel spread their canopies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[ xlv]</a></span>
grateful shade; while the Redwood affords cool retreats from
the summer sun. Then our salt marshes, as though realizing
the need of refreshing verdure, put on their most vivid greens;
and our chaparral-covered hill-slopes make walls of bronze
and olive.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Perhaps no coniferous forests in the world are so beautiful or
so attractive as the Redwood forests of our Coast Ranges; and
they play so important a part in the distribution of our plants,
it will not be out of place to devote a little space to them here.</p>

<p>The main Redwood belt is of limited range, extending along
the Coast from Monterey County to Humboldt County, and
nowhere exceeding twenty miles in breadth. Straggling trees
may be found beyond these limits, but nowhere a forest growth
or trees of great size. In its densest portion, the stately and
colossal trees are too close together to permit of a wagon passing
between them.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy writes: "The Redwood is not only a lover of
moisture, but to an extent hardly to be believed, unless seen,
a condenser and conserver of moisture. Their tops reach high
into the sea of vapor, and a constant precipitation from them,
like rain, takes place. The water stands in puddles in the roads
under them. This causes the densest of undergrowth; hazels,
huckleberries, various Ceanothi, ferns of large size and in
greatest profusion, large bushes of rhododendron, and numerous
other plants make the forest floor a perfect tangle in moister
portions."</p>

<p>Many charming plants find their homes amid the cool shade
of these noble trees. Trillium, and scoliopus, and dog's-tooth
violets vie with clintonias and vancouverias in elegance and
grace, while little creeping violets, and the lovely redwood-sorrel,
and the salal make charming tapestries over the forest
floor about these dim cathedral columns.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the open forest belts of the Sierras,
which are of far greater extent, present another and quite
different flora from that of the Coast Range and the Redwood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[ xlvi]</a></span>
belt. There may be found many interesting plants of the
Heath family&mdash;cassiope, bryanthus, chimaphila, ledum, various
pyrolas, and the snow-plant; there the aconite, false hellebore,
eriogonums and gentians, and new and beautiful pentstemons
and Mimuli and lilies deck the meadows and stream-banks.</p>

<p>After the season of blossoming is over in the lowlands, we
may pass on up into the mountains and live again through a
vernal springtime of flowers.</p>

<p>Perhaps in no country in the world does the arrival of the
spring flowers "so transform the face of Nature as in California."
The march of civilization has brought changes in its
wake; the virgin soil has been broken and subdued into grainfields
and vineyards; still enough of the lavish blossoming is
left us to appreciate Mr. Muir's description of the face of the
country as it appeared years ago. He says: "When California
was wild, it was one sweet bee-garden throughout its entire
length, north and south, and all the way across from the snowy
Sierra to the ocean.... The Great Central Plain ...
during the months of March, April, and May was one smooth,
continuous bed of honey-bloom, so marvelously rich that in
walking from one end of it to the other, a distance of four hundred
miles, your foot would press about a hundred flowers at
every step. Mints, gilias, nemophilas, castilleias, and innumerable
Compositæ were so crowded together, that had ninety-nine
per cent of them been taken away, the plain would still have
seemed to any but Californians extravagantly flowery. The
radiant, honeyful corollas, touching and overlapping and rising
above one another, glowed in the living light like a sunset sky&mdash;one
sheet of purple and gold.... Sauntering in any
direction, hundreds of these happy sun-plants brushed against
my feet at every step and closed over them as if I were wading
in liquid gold. The air was sweet with fragrance, the larks sang
their blessed songs, rising on the wing as I advanced, then
sinking out of sight in the polleny sod; while myriads of wild
bees stirred the lower air with their monotonous hum&mdash;monotonous,
yet forever fresh and sweet as everyday sunshine." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[ xlvii]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward the end of our long cloudless summer, after most
other flowers have stolen away, Mother Nature marshals her
great order of Compositæ for a last rally; and they come as
welcome visitants to fill the places of our vanished summer
friends.</p>

<p>Asters and <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'golden-rod'">goldenrods</ins>, grindelias, lessingias, and the numerous
tarweeds, with their cheerful blossoms, relieve the sober
browns of sun-dried hill-slopes and meadows, or fringe with
color our roadsides and salt marshes.</p>

<p>But even these late-comers weary after a time, and one by
one disappear, till there comes a season when, without flowers,
Nature seems to be humbled in sackcloth and ashes. The
dust lies thick upon roadside trees, a haze hangs like a veil in
the air, and the sun beats down with fierce, continued glare.</p>

<p>As this wears on day after day, a certain vague expectancy
creeps gradually over the face of things&mdash;a rapt, mysterious
aspect, foreboding change. One day there is a telltale clarity
in the atmosphere. Later, the sky darkens by degrees, and a
dull, leaden hue spreads over the vault of heaven. Nature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[ xlviii]</a></span>
mourns, and would weep. Her heart is full to bursting; still
the tears come not. The winds spring up and blow freshly
over the parched land. A few hard-wrung drops begin to fall,
and at length there closes down a thoroughgoing shower.
The flood-gates are opened at last; the long tension is over,
and we breathe freely once more.</p>

<p>During this first autumn rain, those of us who are so fortunate
as to live in the country are conscious of a strange odor
pervading all the air. It is as though Dame Nature were brewing
a vast cup of herb tea, mixing in the fragrant infusion all
the plants dried and stored so carefully during the summer.</p>

<p>When the clouds vanish after this baptismal shower, everything
is charmingly fresh and pure, and we have some of the
rarest of days. Then the little seeds, harbored through the
long summer in Earth's bosom, burst their coats and push
up their tender leaves, till on hillside and valley-floor appears a
delicate mist of green, which gradually confirms itself into a
soft, rich carpet&mdash;and all the world is in verdure clad. Then
we begin to look eagerly for our first flowers.</p>

<h4><i>Dentaria Californica</i>, Nutt. Mustard Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[ 4]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Roots.</i>&mdash;Bearing small tubers. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to two feet
high. <i>Root-leaves.</i>&mdash;Simple and roundish or with three leaflets. <i>Stem-leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually

<p>What a rapture we always feel over this first blossom of the
year! not only for its own dear sake, but for the hopes and
promises it holds out, the visions it raises of spring, with
flower-covered meadows, running brooks, buds swelling everywhere,
bird-songs, and the air rife with perfumes.</p>

<p>It is like the dove sent forth from the ark, this first tentative
blossom, this <i>avant courier</i> of the great army of Crucifers,
or cross-bearers, so called because their four petals are stretched
out like the four arms of a cross.</p>

<p>It is usually in some sheltered wood that we look for this
first shy blossom; but once it has proved the trustworthiness
of the skies, it is followed by thousands of its companions, who
then come out boldly and star the meadows with their pure
white constellations.</p>

<p>The Latin name of this genus (from the word <i>dens</i>, a
tooth), translated into the vernacular, becomes toothwort, the
termination <i>wort</i> signifying merely plant or herb.</p>

<p>It was so named because of the toothed rootstocks of many
species.</p>

<p>The little tubers upon the root often have a pungent taste,
from which comes one of the other common names&mdash;"pepper-root."
Various other names have been applied to these flowers,
such as "lady's smocks" and "milkmaids."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span></p>

<h3>ZYGADENE.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[ 6]</a></span></p>


<h4><i>Zygadenus Fremonti</i>, Michx. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulb.</i>&mdash;Dark-coated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear; a foot or two long; deeply
channeled. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Three inches to even four feet high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White.
<i>Perianth Segments.</i>&mdash;Six; strongly nerved; bearing at base
yellow glands; inner segments clawed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; shorter than
the perianth. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Styles three; short. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Three-beaked.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges, San Diego to Humboldt County.</p></blockquote>

<p>The generic name, <i>Zygadenus</i>, is from the Greek, and signifies
yoked glands, referring to the glands upon the base of
the perianth segments.</p>

<p>We have several species, the most beautiful and showy of
which is <i>Z. Fremonti</i>. This is widely distributed, and grows
in very different situations. In our central Coast Range its
tall stems, with their lovely clusters of white stars, make their
appearance upon rocky hill-slopes with warm exposure, in the
shelter of the trees, soon after the toothwort has sprinkled
the fields with its white bloom. In the south it rears its tall
stems upon open mesas, unprotected by the shelter of friendly
tree or shrub, and in some localities it makes itself at home in
bogs. It is possible that the future may reveal the presence of
more than one species.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been called "soap-plant"; but this name
more appropriately belongs to <i>Chlorogalum</i>. It somewhat
resembles the Star of Bethlehem of Eastern gardens. The fact
that it grows in boggy places has given rise to the name of
"water-lily" in certain localities; but this ought to be discountenanced,
as it bears not the slightest resemblance to the magnificent
water-lily of Eastern ponds.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>Z. venenosus</i>, Wats.&mdash;is found from Monterey
and Mariposa Counties to British Columbia. This may be
distinguished from the above by its narrow leaves&mdash;only two
or three lines wide,&mdash;usually folded together, and by its smaller
flowers, with perianth segments only two or three lines long; and
also by the fact that the stamens equal the segments in length.
The bulb is poisonous, and our Northern Indians call it "death
camass," while the farmers in the Sierras call it "Lobelia," not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[ 8]</a></span>
because of any resemblance to that plant, but because its poisonous
effects are similar to those of the latter. It is fatal to
horses, but hogs eat it with impunity, from which it is also
known as "hogs' potato." It is found in moist meadows or
along stream-banks, in June and July.</p>

<h3>POISON-OAK.</h3>

<h4><i>Rhus diversiloba</i>, Torr. and Gray. Poison-Oak or Cashew Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Shrubs.</i>&mdash;Three to fifteen feet high. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;One to four inches
long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Greenish white; small. <i>Sepals and Petals.</i>&mdash;Usually
five. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;As many or twice as many as the petals. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Styles three: distinct or united. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A small, dry,
striate, whitish drupe. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The presence of the poison-oak in our woods and fields
makes these outdoor haunts forbidden pleasures to persons
who are susceptible to it. It is closely allied to the poison-ivy
of the Eastern States, and very similar in its effects. It is a
charming shrub in appearance, with beautiful glossy, shapely
leaves; and in early summer, when it turns to many shades of
scarlet and purple-bronze, it is especially alluring to the unsuspecting.
It is quite diverse in its habit, sometimes appearing
as an erect shrub, and again climbing trees or rock surfaces, by
means of small aerial rootlets, to a considerable height. Horses
eat the leaves without injury; and the honey which the bees distill
from its small greenish-white flowers is said to be excellent.</p>

<p>Many low plants seek the shelter of these shrubs, and some
of our loveliest flowers, such as Clarkias, Godetias, Collinsias,
Brodiæas, and larkspurs, seem to realize that immunity from
human marauders is to be had within its safe retreat.</p>

<p>The remedies for oak-poisoning are numerous; and it may
not be out of place to mention a few of them here. Different
remedies are required by different individuals. Any of the
following plants may be made into a tea and used as a wash:
Grindelia, manzanita, wild peony, California holly, and <i>Rhamnus
Purshiania</i>, or <i>Californica</i>. Hot solutions of soda, Epsom
salts, or saltpeter are helpful to many, and the bulb of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[ 10]</a></span>
soap-root,&mdash;<i>Chlorogalum pomeridianum</i>&mdash;pounded to a paste
and used as a salve, allowing it to dry upon the surface and
remain for some hours at least, is considered excellent. In fact,
any pure toilet soap may be used in the same manner.</p>

Coast Ranges, from Santa Cruz to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wake-robin is in the vanguard of our spring flowers,
and a walk into some high, cold cañon while the days are still
dark and short will be amply rewarded by the finding of its
white and peculiarly pure-looking blossoms standing upon
the bank overlooking the streamlet. The blossoms remain
unchanged for a time, and then, as they fade, turn to a deep
purplish rose-color.</p>

<p>Our wake-robin so closely resembles <i>T. grandiflorum</i>,
Salisb., of the Eastern States, that it seems a pity it should
have been made into a different species.</p>


<h3>BEACH-STRAWBERRY.</h3>

<p>This beautiful strawberry is found growing near the seashore,
where its large, delicious berries are often buried
beneath the shifting sand, becoming bleached in color. It
sometimes covers acres with its thick, shining, dark-green
leaves, among which are sprinkled its large pure-white flowers,
an inch or more across.</p>

<p>The wood-strawberry&mdash;<i>F. Californica</i>&mdash;is very common in
the Coast Ranges; but for the most part it is dry and flavorless.</p>

<h3>MANZANITA. BEARBERRY.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[ 12]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Arctostaphylos manzanita</i>, Parry. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs three to twenty-five feet high, with purple-brown bark.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Pale. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or pinkish; in crowded clusters.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Four or five lines long; campanulate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
filaments dilated and bearded at base; anthers two-celled, opening terminally,
each cell furnished with a long downward-pointing horn.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Globose; five to ten-celled. Style simple. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Six lines
in diameter, containing several bony nutlets. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Arctostaphylos
pungens</i>, HBK. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all our shrubs, the manzanita is the most beautiful and
the best known. Sometimes as early as Christmas it may be
found in full bloom, when its dense crown of pale foliage, surmounting
the rich purple-brown stems, is thickly sown with
the little clusters of fragrant waxen bells. After the blossoms
have passed away, the shrubs put forth numerous brilliant
scarlet or crimson shoots, which at a little distance look like a
strange and entirely new kind of blossoming. The manzanita
is closely allied to the madroño, and resembles it in many
ways, particularly in the annual peeling of its rich red bark
and in the form of its flowers.</p>

<p>The Greek generic name, translated into English, becomes
"bearberry." The pretty Spanish name&mdash;from <i>manzana</i>,
apple, and the diminutive, <i>ita</i>,&mdash;was bestowed by the early
Spanish-Californians, who recognized the resemblance of the
fruit to tiny apples.</p>

<p>We have a dozen or more species of <i>Arctostaphylos</i>, but <i>A.
manzanita</i> is the commonest of them all. It varies greatly in
size and habit. In localities most favorable it becomes a large,
erect shrub, with many clustered trunks, while in the Sierras
it finds but a precarious footing among the granite rocks, often
covering their surfaces with its small tortuous, stiff branches.
The leaves, by a twisting of their stalks, assume a vertical position
on the branches, a habit which enables many plants of dry
regions to avoid unnecessary evaporation.</p>
<div class="image" id="f005"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f005.png">MANZANITA&mdash;<i>Arctostaphylos manzanita</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The largest manzanita known is upon the estate of Mr.
Tiburcio Parrott, in St. Helena, Napa County, California. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[ 14]</a></span>
is thirty-five feet high, with a spread of branches equal to its
height, while its trunk measures eleven and a half feet in circumference
at the ground, soon dividing into large branches.
It is a veritable patriarch, and has doubtless seen many centuries.
According to an interesting account in "Garden and
Forest," it once had a narrow escape from the ax of a woodman.
A gentleman who was a lover of trees, happening to
pass, paid the woodman two dollars to spare its life.</p>

<p>Years ago no traveler from the East felt that he could return
home without a manzanita cane, made from as straight a
branch as could be secured.</p>

<p>The berries of this shrub are dry and bony and quite unsatisfactory.
They are, however, pleasantly acid, and have been
put to several uses. It is said that both brandy and vinegar
are made from them, and housewives make quite a good jelly
from some species. Bears are fond of the berries, and the
Indians eat them, both raw and pounded into a flour, from which
mush is made. The leaves made into a tincture or infusion are
now an officinal drug, valued in catarrh of the throat or stomach.</p>

<p>From Monterey to San Diego is found <i>A. glauca</i>, Lindl.,
the great-berried manzanita. It closely resembles the above,
but its berries are three fourths of an inch in diameter.</p>

<p>Of the same range as the last is <i>A. bicolor</i>, Gray, whose
leaves are of a rich, shining green above and white and woolly
beneath. Its berries are the size of a pea, yellowish at first,
and turning red later.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN SAXIFRAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Saxifraga Californica</i>, Greene. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

petioles six to twelve lines long. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen inches high.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or rose; four or five lines across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply
five-cleft, with reflexed lobes. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Borne on the calyx. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten.
<i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Two; partly united. Styles short. Stigmas capitate.

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f006.png">CALIFORNIAN SAXIFRAGE&mdash;<i>Saxifraga Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the rich soil of cool northward slopes, or on many a
mossy bank amid the tender young fronds of the maidenhair,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[ 16]</a></span>
may be found the delicate clusters of our little Californian saxifrage.
The plants are small, with but a few, perhaps only one
or two, oval, rather hairy leaves, lying upon the ground, and a
slender red scape upholding the dainty cluster of small white
flowers. The tips of the calyx-lobes are usually red, and the
wee stamens are pink.</p>

<p>We have several species of saxifrage, most of which are
plants of exceeding delicacy and grace, and with small flowers.</p>


<h3>MINER'S LETTUCE. INDIAN LETTUCE.</h3>

<h4><i>Montia perfoliata</i>, Howell. Purslane Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Smooth, succulent herbs. <i>Radical Leaves.</i>&mdash;Long-petioled; broadly
rhomboidal. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Simple; six to twelve inches high, having, near
the summit, a pair of leaves united around the stem. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five, minute. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled
Style slender. Stigma three-cleft. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Claytonia perfoliata</i>,
Don. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though our Indian lettuce is closely allied to the Eastern
"Spring Beauty," one would never suspect it from its outward
appearance and habit. The little flower-racemes look as
though they might have pushed their way right through the
rather large saucer-like leaf just below them. The succulent
leaves and stems are greedily eaten by the Indians, from which
it is called "Indian lettuce."</p>

<p>Mr. Powers, of Sheridan, writes that the Placer County Indians
have a novel way of preparing their salad. Gathering
the stems and leaves, they lay them about the entrances of the
nests of certain large red ants. These, swarming out, run all
over it. After a time the Indians shake them off, satisfied that
the lettuce has a pleasant sour taste equaling that imparted
by vinegar. These little plants are said to be excellent when
boiled and well seasoned, and they have long been grown in
England, where they are highly esteemed for salads.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>

<h3>WOOD ANEMONE. WIND-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Anemone quinquefolia</i>, L. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Horizontal. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Six to fourteen inches high.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical leaf remote from the stem; trifid; the segments serrate.
Involucral leaf not far below the flower; three foliolate. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Petaloid;
five or six; usually bluish outside. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Wanting. <i>Stamens
and Pistils.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Akenes.</i>&mdash;Two lines long; twelve to
twenty. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Anemone nemorosa</i>, L. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, in
moist shade.</p></blockquote>

<p>The delicate blossoms of the wood anemone might at first
be confounded with those of the toothwort by the careless
observer, but a moment's reflection will quickly distinguish
them. The anemone is always a solitary flower with many
stamens, and its petals are of a more delicate texture. It
grows upon wooded banks or cool, shaded flats among the
redwoods.</p>

<p>There are many quaint traditions as to the origin of its
name, and poets have from early times found something ideal
of which to sing in these simple spring flowers.</p>

<p>The generic name has the accent upon the third syllable,
but, when Anglicized into the common name, the accent falls
back upon the second.</p>


<h3>OSO-BERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Nuttallia cerasiformis</i>, Torr. and Gray. Rose Family</h4>

<blockquote><p>Deciduous shrubs; two to fifteen feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Broadly oblanceolate;
two to four inches long; narrowed into a short petiole.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; in short terminal racemes; di&#339;cious; three to eleven
lines across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Top-shaped, with five-lobed border. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five;
inserted with ten of the stamens on the calyx; broadly spatulate.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Fifteen. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Five. Styles short. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Blue-black,
oblong drupes; six to eight lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Chiefly the Coast
Ranges from San Luis Obispo to Fraser River.</p></blockquote>

<p>About the same time that the beautiful leaves of the buckeye
are emerging from their wrappings, we notice in the woods
a shrub which has just put forth its clusters of bright-green
leaves from buds all along its slender twigs. Amid their
delicate green hang short clusters of greenish-white flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[ 20]</a></span>
These blossoms have a delicious bitter fragrance, redolent of
all the tender memories of the springtime.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f008.png">WOOD ANEMONE&mdash;<i>Anemone quinquefolia.</i></a></p>

<p>This shrub is usually mistaken for a wild plum; and the
illusion is still further assisted when the little drupes, like miniature
plums, begin to ripen and hang in yellow and purple
clusters amid the matured leaves.</p>


<h3>WILD DATE. SPANISH BAYONET.</h3>

<h4><i>Yucca Mohavensis</i>, Sargent. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Trunk.</i>&mdash;Usually simple; rarely exceeding fifteen feet high; six or
eight inches in diameter; naked, or covered with refracted dead leaves,
or clothed to the ground with the living leaves. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear-lanceolate;
one to three feet long; one or two inches wide; rigid; margins
at length bearing coarse recurved threads. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In short-stemmed
or sessile, distaff-shaped panicles, a foot or two long; pedicels
eventually drooping, twelve to eighteen lines long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Broadly
campanulate. <i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Six; thirty lines long; six to twelve wide.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; six to nine lines long; filaments white, club-shaped.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Oblong; white; an inch or two long, including the slender
style. Stigmas three. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Cylindrical; three or four inches long;
pendulous, pulpy. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Yucca baccata</i>, Torr. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southern
California, from Monterey to San Diego; coast and inland.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Yucca</i> comprises sixteen or eighteen species, and
reaches its greatest development in Northern Mexico. Three
species are to be found within our borders, two of which are
arborescent, <i>Y. arborescens</i>, and <i>Y. Mohavensis</i>. Considerable
confusion has hitherto reigned among the species, but
they are now better understood.</p>

<p>They are all valuable to our Indians as basket and textile
plants, and are useful to them in many other ways.</p>

<p>Owing to the structure of the flowers, self-fertilization seems
impossible, and scientists who have made a study of the subject
say that these plants are dependent upon a little white,
night-flying moth to perform this office for them. This little
creature goes from plant to plant, gathering the pollen, which
she rolls up into a ball with her feet. When sufficient has
been gathered, she goes to another plant, lays her egg in its
ovary, and before leaving ascends to the stigma and actually
pushes the pollen into it, seeming to realize that unless she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[ 21]</a></span>
performs this last act, there will be nothing for her progeny to
eat. This seems an almost incredible instance of insect intelligence;
but it is a well-authenticated fact.</p>

<p><i>Yucca Mohavensis</i>, commonly called "wild date," or
"Spanish bayonet," is more widely distributed within our
borders than either of our other species. Its large panicle of
overpoweringly fragrant white waxen bells is a striking object
wherever seen. On the coast this yucca is often stemless,
but in the interior, where it is more abundant, it rises to a
considerable height, and culminates upon the Mojave Desert,
where the finest specimens are found.</p>

<p>The fruit, which ripens in August and September, turns
from green to a tawny yellow, afterward becoming brownish
purple, and eventually almost black. This has a sweet, succulent
flesh, and, either fresh or dried, is a favorite fruit among
the Indians. Dr. Palmer writes that this is one of the most
useful plants to the Indians of New Mexico, Arizona, and
Southern California. They cut the stems into slices, beat
them into a pulp, and mix them with the water in washing, as
a substitute for soap.</p>

<p>The leaves are parched in ashes, to make them pliable, and
are afterward soaked in water and pounded with a wooden
mallet. The fibers thus liberated are long, strong, and durable,
and lend themselves admirably to the weaving of the
gayly decorated horse-blankets made by the tribes of Southern
California. They also make from it ropes, twine, nets, hats,
hair-brushes, shoes, mattresses, baskets, etc.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[ 22]</a></span></p>


<h3>FALSE SOLOMON'S SEAL.</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Slender; branching; creeping; scars not conspicuous.
<i>Stem.</i>&mdash;About a foot long (sometimes two); usually zigzag above;
leafy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; sessile; lanceolate; two to six inches long;
shining above; spreading in a horizontal plane. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; few;
in a simple terminal raceme, on pedicels two to seven lines long.
<i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Of six, distinct, spreading segments. <i>Segments.</i>&mdash;One
and one half to four lines long; lanceolate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; half the
length of the segments. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style short. <i>Berry.</i>&mdash;Nearly
black; three to five lines through. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Monterey to British
Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The False Solomon's Seal is one of the prettiest plants in
our woods in March, and in many places it almost hides the
ground from view. It has a graceful, drooping habit that
shows its handsome, spreading leaves to full advantage, and
its few delicate little white blossoms are a fitting termination
to the pretty sprays.</p>

<p><i>S. amplexicaulis</i>, Nutt., is a very handsome, decorative
plant, with fine, tall, leafy stem, and large, feathery panicle of
tiny white flowers. The broadened white filaments are the
most conspicuous part of these blossoms, which are less than a
line long. The berries are light-colored, dotted with red or
purple.</p>


<h3>MIST-MAIDENS.</h3>

<h4><i>Romanzoffia Sitchensis</i>, Bongard. Baby-eyes or Water leaf Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen lines across; smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White,
pink, or purple. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Funnel-form;
five-lobed; four lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges, from Santa Cruz northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In appearance these delicate herbs resemble the saxifrages,
and they affect much the same sort of places, decking mossy
banks and stream borders with their beautiful scalloped leaves
and small white flowers.</p>

<p>The genus was named in honor of Nicholas Romanzoff, a
Russian nobleman, who, by his munificence, enabled some
noted botanists to visit this coast early in the century.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span></p>

<h3>STRAWBERRY CACTUS.</h3>
<h3>CALIFORNIAN FISH-HOOK CACTUS. LLAVINA.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[ 24]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Mamillaria Goodridgii</i>, Scheer. Cactus Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Oval, fleshy, leafless plants; mostly single, though sometimes
clustered; three to five inches long; covered with prominences or
tubercles. <i>Tubercles.</i>&mdash;Each bearing a flat rosette of short, whitish
spines, with an erect, dark, fish-hook-like central one. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small;
greenish-white. <i>Outer Sepals.</i>&mdash;Fringed. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;About eight;
awned. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Stigmas five or
six. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Scarlet; an inch long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Diego and neighboring
islands, and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The dry hill-slopes about San Diego afford the most interesting
field accessible to civilization, <i>i.e.</i> within our boundaries,
for the gathering and study of the cacti.</p>

<p>Nestling close to the ground, usually under some shrub or
vine, you will find the little fish-hook cactus, one of the prettiest
and most interesting of them all. Its oval form bristles
with the little dark hooks, each of which emanates from a flat
star of whitish spines.</p>

<p>The flowers may be found in April or May, but it is more
noticeable when in fruit. The handsome scarlet berries, like
old-fashioned coral eardrops, protruding from among the
thorns, are easily picked out, and they very naturally find their
way to one's mouth. Nor is one disappointed in the expectation
raised by their brilliant exterior&mdash;for the flavor is delicious,
though I cannot say it resembles that of the strawberry,
as some aver. To me it is more like a fine tart apple.</p>


<h3>THIMBLE-BERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Rubus Nutkanus</i>, Mocino. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Palmately and nearly
equally five-lobed; cordate at base; four to twelve inches broad; the
lobes acute; densely tomentose beneath. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Few; clustered;
white, sometimes pale rose; an inch or two across, with rounded petals.
<i>Stamens and Pistils.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Large; red; "like an
inverted saucer;" sweet and rather dry. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Monterey to Alaska.</p></blockquote>

<p>The thimble-berry is unequaled for the canopy of pure
light-green foliage which it spreads in our woods. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[ 25]</a></span>
take the clearest of water-colors to portray its color and texture.
The large white flowers, with their crumpled petals, are
deliciously fragrant, but with us are never followed by an
edible fruit, probably owing to the dryness of our summer
climate. In Oregon and northward the berries are said to be
luscious. There the bushes grow in the fir forests, where they
seem most at home.</p>

<p><i>Rubus spectabilis</i>, Pursh., the salmon-berry, has leaves with
three leaflets, and large solitary, rose-colored flowers, which
are followed by a salmon-colored berry. These shrubs are
exceedingly beautiful when in full bloom.</p>


<h3>COMMON WILD PEA.</h3>

<h4><i>Lathyrus vestitus</i>, Nutt. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to ten feet high; slender; not winged. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;
Alternate; with small semi-sagittate stipules; pinnate, with four to six
pairs of leaflets; tendril-bearing at the summit. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Ovate-oblong
to linear; six to twelve lines long; acute. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White,
pale rose or violet; seven to ten lines long. <i>Lower Calyx-teeth.</i>&mdash;About
equaling the tube. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Papilionaceous; the standard veined
with purple in the center. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine united; one free. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Flattened;
pubescent. Style hairy down the inner side. (See <i>Leguminosæ</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Sonoma County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Lathyrus</i>, which contains the beautiful sweet pea
of the garden, affords us several handsome wild species, but
most of them are difficult of determination, and many of them
are as yet much confused. This genus is quite closely related
to <i>Vicia</i>, but, in general, the leaflets are broader, the flowers
are larger, and the style is hairy down the inner side as well as
at the tip.</p>

<p><i>Lathyrus vestitus</i> is the common wild pea of the south. It
is quite plentiful, and clambers over and under shrubs, hanging
out its occasional clusters of rather large pale flowers.</p>

<p><i>L. Torreyi</i>, Gray, found from Santa Clara County to Napa
in dry woods, is a slender plant, having from one to three
small white or pinkish flowers. It is remarkable for and easily
distinguished by its very fragrant foliage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[ 26]</a></span></p>


<h3>WILD CUCUMBER. BIG-ROOT. CHILICOTHE.</h3>

<h4><i>Echinocystis fabacea</i>, Naudin. Gourd Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Tendril-bearing vines, ten to thirty feet long. <i>Root.</i>&mdash;Enormous;
woody. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Palmately five- to seven-lobed; three to six inches
broad. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellowish white; mon&#339;cious. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Campanulate;
teeth small or none. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Five- to seven-lobed; three
to six lines across. <i>Staminate Flowers.</i>&mdash;Five to twenty in racemes;
their stamens two and a half, with short connate filaments and somewhat
horizontal anthers. <i>Pistillate Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; from the same
axils as the racemes. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- to four-celled. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Two
inches long; prickly. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Megarrhiza Californica</i>, Torr. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near
the coast, from San Diego to Point Reyes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild cucumber is one of our most graceful native vines.
It drapes many an unsightly stump, or clambers up into
shrubs, embowering them with its pretty foliage. Seeing its
rather delicate ivy-like habit above ground, one would never
dream that it came from a root as large as a man's body,
buried deep in the earth. From this root, it has received two
of its common names, "big-root" and "man-in-the-ground."
Sometimes this may be seen upon the ocean beach or rolling
about in the breakers, where it has been liberated by the wearing
away of the cliffs. It is intensely bitter.</p>

<p>The seeds have a very interesting method of germinating.
The two large radical leaves remain underground, sending up
the terminal shoot only. They are so tender and succulent
that they would be eaten forthwith, if they showed themselves
above the ground. An oil expressed from the roasted
seeds has been used by the Indians to promote the growth of
the hair.</p>

<p>Authorities have differed about the classification of these
plants, and they have been variously called <i>Megarrhiza,
Micrampelis</i>, and <i>Echinocystis</i>, the latter being latest approved.
We have several species. One common in the South is <i>E.
macrocarpa</i>, Greene. This has a large oval, prickly ball, four
inches or so long. When mature, this opens at the top, splitting
into several segments, which gradually roll downward,
like the petals of a beautiful white lily, showing their pure-white
inner surfaces and leaving exposed the four cells in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[ 28]</a></span>
center, with <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'lace-like'">lacelike</ins> walls, in which nestle the large, handsome
dark seeds. These seeds are often beautifully mottled and
colored, and in the early days served the Spanish-Californian
children for marbles.</p>

<h3>WHITE LAYIA. WHITE DAISY.</h3>

<h4><i>Layia glandulosa</i>, Hook. and Arn. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six to twelve inches high; loosely branching; hairy; often
reddish. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Sessile; linear; the upper all small and entire; the
lower often lanceolate and incised pinnatifid. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Usually large
and showy. <i>Ray-flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright, pure white, sometimes rose-color;
eight to thirteen; three-lobed; an inch or less long; six lines wide.
<i>Disk-flowers.</i>&mdash;Golden yellow; five-toothed. Each scale of the involucre
clasping a ray-flower. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Columbia River to Los Angeles.</p></blockquote>

<p>These white daisies, as they are commonly called in the
south, cover the fields and plains in early spring, jostling one
another in friendly proximity and stretching away in an endless
perspective. They are of a charming purity, and to me
are more attractive than their sisters, the tidy-tips.</p>

<p>They love a sandy soil, and I have seen them flourishing in
the disintegrated granite of old river-beds, where the dazzling
whiteness of the stones was hardly distinguishable from the
blossoms. The involucre is thickly studded with curious little
glands, resembling small glass-headed pins.</p>


<h3>BED-STRAW. GOOSE-GRASS. CLEAVERS.</h3>

<h4><i>Galium Aparine</i>, L. Madder Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Climbing by the prickly stem-angles and leaf-margins. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Weak;
one to four feet long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;In whorls of six to eight;
linear oblanceolate; one inch long. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Elongated; one- to
two-flowered. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Minute; one line across; greenish-white.
<i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Adnate to the ovary; limb obsolete. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Mostly
four-cleft. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-lobed, two-celled. Styles
two, short. Stigmas, capitate. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Two or three lines across,
covered with hooked bristles. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>All through our moist woodlands, in early spring, the long
stems of the bed-straw may be found, running about upon the
ground or entangled amid the stems of other plants. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[ 29]</a></span>
angles of these weak stems and the leaf-margins and midribs
are all clothed with small backward-pointing bristles, which
make the plants cling to surrounding objects. The flowers are
greenish and minute, and are followed by tiny prickly balls.</p>

<p>A cold infusion of this little plant is used as a domestic
remedy in cases of fever, where a cooling drink is desired.</p>

<p>The genus has received the common name of "bed-straw,"
because it was supposed that one of the species, <i>G. verum</i>,
filled the manger in which was laid the Infant Jesus. There
are a dozen or so species in California.</p>

<p>Very conspicuous all through the south is <i>G. angustifolium</i>,
Nutt., often three feet high, sending up very numerous slender,
feathery stems from a woody base. This has its small leaves
in whorls of four.</p>


<h3>MOUNTAIN HEART'S-EASE.</h3>

<h4><i>Viola Beckwithii</i>, Torr. and Gray. Violet Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Broadly cordate in outline; three-parted; the divisions
cleft into linear or oblong segments. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;About equaling the
leaves. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four to seven lines long; very broad; the upper
deep purple, the others lilac, bluish, or white, veined with purple, with
a yellowish base; the lateral bearded; the lowest emarginate. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Bearded
at the sides. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Obtuse. (Otherwise as <i>V. pedunculata</i>.)

<h3>POP-CORN FLOWER.</h3>

<h3>WHITE FORGET-ME-NOT. NIEVITAS.</h3>

<h4>Borage Family.</h4>

<p>The wild white forget-me-nots are among our most welcome
flowers. Though not showy, taken singly, they often
cover the fields, presenting the appearance of a light snowfall,
from which fact the Spanish-Californians have bestowed the
pretty name "nievitas," the diminutive of <i>nieve</i>, snow.</p>

<p>Their chief charm often lies in their pure, delightful fragrance,
which recalls the days of our careless, happy childhood.
Children are keen observers of flowers, and are among their
most appreciative lovers, and with them these modest, chaste
little blossoms are special favorites.</p>

<p>There are many species, and even genera, and their determination
is beset with serious difficulties. It requires endless
study and patience to disentangle the facts about any one of
them. They are comprised under several genera, <i>Krynitzkia</i>,
<i>Plagiobothrys</i>, <i>Eritrichium</i>, <i>Piptocalyx</i>, etc. Some have fragrant
flowers and some have not. Children of the south call
them "pop-corn flowers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>

<h3>WHIPPLEA.</h3>

<h4><i>Whipplea modesta</i>, Torr. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Slender, diffuse, hairy undershrubs. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; short-petioled;
ovate; toothed or entire; an inch or less long; three-nerved.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; barely three lines across; in small terminal clusters.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;White; five-cleft. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Usually ten.
Filaments awl-shaped. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three- to five-celled, globose. Styles
of the same number. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges from Monterey to Mendocino
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the redwoods, or in moist cañons in their vicinity,
may be found this pretty undershrub trailing over banks or
brushwood. In April its exquisite little clusters of pure white
flowers, with a pleasant fragrance, make their appearance, and
the plants have then been sometimes mistaken for a species of
<i>Ceanothus</i>.</p>


<h3>WOODLAND STAR OF BETHLEHEM.</h3>

<h4><i>Tellima affinis</i>, Bolander. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; six to twenty inches high. <i>Root-leaves.</i>&mdash;Round-reniform;
scalloped; rarely an inch across. <i>Stem-leaves.</i>&mdash;Three to
five; ternately cleft; variously toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; in a loose
raceme; nine lines across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Small; campanulate; five-toothed.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; wedge-shaped, with three acute lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten.
Filaments very short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Styles, three, short,
stout. Stigmas, capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Shady places almost throughout the
State.</p></blockquote>

<p>"Star of Bethlehem" is the common name by which many
of our children know this fragile flower. Its slender stems rise
from many a mossy bank, upbearing their few delicately
slashed, pure-white stars, which seem to shed a gentle radiance
about them upon the woodland scene.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></p>

<h3>WILD BUCKWHEAT.</h3>

<h4><i>Eriogonum fasciculatum</i>, Bentham. Buckwheat Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby; very leafy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; nearly sessile; narrowly
oblanceolate; acute; tomentose beneath; glabrous above; three to nine
lines long; much fascicled. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or pinkish; in densely
crowded compound clusters; several perianths contained in the involucres.
<i>Involucres.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five- or six- nerved and toothed;
two lines high. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Minute; of six nearly equal segments.
(See <i>Eriogonum umbellatum</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara and southward;
east to Arizona.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild buckwheat is a characteristic feature of the southern
landscape. It is a charming plant when in full bloom, and
its feathery clusters of pinkish-white flowers show finely against
the warm olive tones of its foliage. It is a very important
honey plant, as it yields an exceptionally pure nectar and
remains in bloom a long time. Growing near the sea, it is
often close-cropped and shorn by the wind, and then it quite
closely resembles the <i>Adenostoma</i>, or chamisal.</p>

<p>Another very widely distributed and common species is <i>E.
nudum</i>, Dougl. Every one is familiar with its tall, green,
naked, rushlike stems, bearing on the ends of the branchlets
the small balls of white or pinkish flowers. Its leaves are
all radical, smooth green above and densely white-woolly
beneath.</p>


<h3>SIERRA PLUM. WILD PLUM.</h3>

<h4><i>Prunus subcordata</i>, Benth. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Trees or shrubs three to ten feet high, with ash-gray bark and branchlets
occasionally spinescent. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Short-petioled; ovate; sharply
and finely serrate; an inch or two long. <i>Umbels.</i>&mdash;Two- to four-flowered.
Pedicels three to six lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; six lines
across. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Red or purple; six to fifteen lines long; fleshy;
smooth. (Otherwise as <i>P. ilicifolia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mostly eastward of the
Central Valley, from San Felipe into Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild plum reaches its greatest perfection in the north,
where the shrubs are found in extensive groves covering whole
mountain slopes.</p>
<div class="image" id="f013"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f013.png">WILD BUCKWHEAT&mdash;<i>Eriogonum fasciculatum.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The flowers, which are produced before the leaves, from
March to May, are white, fading to rose-color. By August<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[ 36]</a></span>
and September, the bushes are loaded with the handsome
fruit, richly mottled with red, yellow, and purple; and these
colors are duplicated in the autumn foliage, which in the North
becomes very brilliant.</p>

<p>This fruit is excellent for canning, preserving, and making
into jelly. Many families make annual pilgrimages to these
wild-plum orchards of the mountains and carry away bushels
of the fruit; but even then countless tons of it go to waste.</p>

<p><i>P. demissa</i>, Walpers,&mdash;the wild cherry or choke-cherry,&mdash;is
found upon mountains throughout the State, but less abundantly
near the coast. Its small white flowers grow in racemes
three or four inches long, and these ripen into the pretty
shining black cherries, half an inch in diameter. It often
covers acres upon acres of rough land, and commences to bear
when but two feet high.</p>

<p>Housewives of our mountain districts make a marmalade
of the fruit, which has a peculiarly delicious, tart flavor.</p>


<h3>ELLISIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Ellisia chrysanthemifolia</i>, Benth. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>More or less hairy. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Loosely branching; a foot or so high.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly opposite; auricled at base; twice- or thrice-parted
into many short, small lobes. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In loose racemes; white;
three lines or so across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft; without appendages at
the sinuses; almost equaling the corolla. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Open-campanulate;
having ten minute scales at base within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled; globose. Style slender; two-cleft. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San
Francisco to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>These little plants, with delicately dissected leaves, are
common in moist, shaded localities; but, unfortunately, their
foliage has a very strong odor, which just escapes being agreeable.
Their general aspect is somewhat similar to that of some
of the small species of <i>Nemophila</i>; but the lack of appendages
upon the calyx reveals their separate identity. It blooms
freely from March to June, and is especially abundant southward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[ 37]</a></span></p>


<h3>MADROÑO. MADRONE.</h3>

<h4><i>Arbutus Menziesii</i>, Pursh. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or trees. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; petioled; oblong; entire or
serrulate; four inches or so long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; waxen; in large
clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft; minute; white. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Broadly urn-shaped;
three lines long; with five minute, recurved teeth. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
on the corolla. Filaments dilated; bearded. Anthers two-celled;
saccate; opening terminally; furnished with a pair of reflexed horns
near the summit. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. Style rather long. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A
cluster of scarlet-orange berries, with rough granular coats. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Puget
Sound to Mexico and Texas; specially in the Coast Ranges.</p></blockquote>

<p>The name "madroño" was applied by the early Spanish-Californians
to this tree because of its strong resemblance and
close relationship to the <i>Arbutus unido</i>, or strawberry-tree of
the Mediterranean countries, which was called madroño in
Spain.</p>

<p>Our madroño, though but a large shrub in the south, increases
in size northward, and reaches its maximum development
in Marin County, where there are some superb specimens
of it. One tree upon the shores of Lake Lagunitas measures
more than twenty-three feet in circumference and a hundred
feet in height, and sends out many large branches, each two or
three feet in diameter.</p>

<p>A large part of the forest growth on the northern slopes of
Mt. Tamalpais is composed of it; and as it is an evergreen, it
forms a mountain wall of delightful and refreshing green the
year around. The bark on the younger limbs, which is of a
rich Indian red, begins to peel off in thin layers about midsummer,
leaving a clear, smooth, greenish-buff surface, and
strewing the forest floor with its warm shreds, which mingling
with the exquisite tones of its ripened leaves, which have fallen
at about the same time, make a carpet equal in beauty of coloring
to that under the English beeches. It is thoroughly patrician
in all its parts. The leaves which are clustered at the
ends of the slender twigs are rich, polished green above, and
somewhat paler beneath.</p>

<p>In the spring it puts forth great panicles of small, white,
waxen bells, which call the bees to a sybaritic feast, and in the
autumn it spreads a no less inviting repast in its great clusters
of fine scarlet berries for the blue pigeons who visit it in large
flocks.</p>

<p>The wood of the madrone is hard and close-grained, of a
light brown, shaded with red, with lighter-colored sap-wood.
It is used in the manufacture of furniture, but is particularly
valuable for the making of charcoal to be used in the composition
of gunpowder. The bark is sometimes used in tanning
leather.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[ 39]</a></span></p>


<h3>WILD WHITE LILAC.</h3>

<h4><i>Ceanothus velutinus</i>, Dougl. Buckthorn Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Widely branching shrubs, two to six feet or more high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; roundish, or broadly ovate; eighteen lines to
three inches long; polished, resinous above; somewhat pubescent beneath;
strongly three-nerved. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; three lines across;
in large, dense, compound clusters four or five inches long and wide.
(See <i>Ceanothus</i> for flower structure.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges; Columbia
River, southward to San Francisco Bay; also eastward to Colorado.</p></blockquote>

<p>Its ample bright-green, highly varnished leaves and large
white flower-clusters make this a very beautiful species of
<i>Ceanothus</i>. The foliage is glutinous with a gummy exudation,
which has a rather disagreeable odor. Yet the shrub would
be very handsome in cultivation.</p>


<h3>WHITE NEMOPHILA.</h3>

<h4><i>Nemophila atomaria</i>, Fisch. and Mey. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Pure white, closely dark-dotted nearly to the edge; an
inch or less across; densely hairy within the tube. Scales of the corolla
narrow, with long hairs. (Otherwise as <i>N. insignis</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Central
California.</p></blockquote>

<p>This delicate <i>Nemophila</i> haunts wet, springy places among
the hills, and is at its best in early spring. There are a number
of small-flowered forms of <i>Nemophila</i> which have been
hitherto referred to <i>N. parviflora</i>, but which the future will
probably prove to constitute a number of species.</p>

<p><i>N. maculata</i>, Benth., found in Middle California and the
High Sierras, is a charming form, with large flowers, whose
petals bear strong violet blotches at the top.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[ 40]</a></span></p>


<h3>RATTLE-WEED. LOCO-WEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Astragalus leucopsis</i>, Torr. and Gray. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or so high. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;In many pairs; six lines or
more long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Greenish-white; six lines long; in spikelike
racemes an inch or two long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With teeth more than half the
length of the campanulate-tube. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Thin; bladdery-inflated; an
inch or more long, on a smooth stalk twice or thrice the length of the
calyx-tube. (See Astragalus.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>These plants are very noticeable and quite pretty, with their
pale foliage, symmetrical leaves, and white flowers; but they
are dreaded by the farmers of the region of their growth, who
aver that they are deadly loco-weeds. It is said that native
stock will not touch them; but animals brought from a distance
and unacquainted with them, eat them, with dreadful
results of loco.</p>

<p>We have numerous species, all rather difficult of determination.</p>


<h3>WILD MORNING-GLORY.</h3>

<h4><i>Convolvulus luteolus</i>, Gray. Morning-Glory Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Twining and climbing twenty feet or more. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
sagittate; two inches or so long; smooth. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Several-flowered;
axillary, with two small linear-lanceolate bracts a
little below the flower. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Cream-color or pinkish, sometimes
deep rose. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five; without bracts immediately below them.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Open funnel-form; eighteen lines long; not lobed or angled.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Globose; two-celled or imperfectly four-celled.
Style filiform. Stigmas two. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>I remember long stretches of mountain road where the wild
morning-glory has completely covered the unsightly shrubs
charred by a previous year's fire, flinging out its slender
stems, lacing and interlacing them in airy festoons, which are
covered with the fragile flowers in greatest profusion. In these
tangles, the industrious spiders have hung their exquisite
geometrical webs, which catch the glittering water-drops in
their meshes. When the sun comes out after a dense, cool
fog-bath on a summer morning, nothing more charmingly
fresh could be imagined than such a scene.</p>
<div class="image" id="f014"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f014.png">RATTLE-WEED&mdash;<i>Astragalus leucopsis.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The common morning-glory of the south&mdash;<i>C. occidentalis</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[ 42]</a></span>
Gray&mdash;is very similar to the above, but may be distinguished
from it by the pair of large, thin bracts immediately below the
calyx and enveloping it.</p>

<p>Another very pretty species is <i>C. villosus</i>, Gray. This is
widely distributed, but not very common. Its trailing stems
and foliage are of a velvety sage-gray throughout, and its
small flowers of a yellowish cream-color. The hastate leaves
are shapely, and the whole plant is charming when grown
away from dust.</p>

<p>The common European bindweed&mdash;<i>C. arvensis</i>, L.&mdash;is to
the farmer a very unwelcome little immigrant. In fields it
becomes a serious pest; for the more its roots are disturbed
and broken up the better it thrives. But despite its bad character,
we cannot help admiring its pretty little white funnels,
which lift themselves so debonairly among the prostrate stems
and leaves.</p>

<p>In medicine a tincture of the whole plant is valued for several
uses.</p>


<h3>WOOD-BALM. PITCHER-SAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Sphacele calycina</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Woody at the base; two to five feet high; hairy or woolly. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two
to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Dull white or purplish; an inch
or more long; mostly solitary in the upper axils. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Having a hairy ring at base within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four, in two
pairs. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. Style filiform. Stigma two-lobed.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry hills. San Francisco Bay, southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wood-balm is closely allied to the sages, which fact is
betrayed by its opposite, wrinkly, sage-scented leaves; but its
flowers have quite a different aspect. These are ample and
cylindrical, with a five-lobed border, one of the lobes being
prolonged into somewhat of a lip.</p>

<p>The generic name is from the Greek word meaning <i>sage</i>;
and the specific name, signifying <i>cuplike</i>, refers to the shape
of the blossoms.</p>

<p>The dwellers among our southern mountains, with that
happy instinct possessed by those who live close to the heart
of nature, have aptly named this "pitcher-sage."</p>

<div class="image" id="f015"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f015.png">PITCHER-SAGE&mdash;<i>Sphacele calycina.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>After the flowers have passed away, the large inflated, light-green<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[ 44]</a></span>
calyxes, densely crowded upon the stems, become quite
conspicuous.</p>

<h3>YUCCA-PALM. TREE-YUCCA. JOSHUA-TREE.</h3>

<h4><i>Yucca arborescens</i>, Trelease. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Scraggly trees; thirty, or forty feet high; with trunks one or two feet in
diameter. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Eight inches long; crowded; rigid; spine-tipped;
serrulate; the older ones reflexed and sun-bleached, the younger ashy-green.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In sessile, ovate panicles, terminating the branches.
Panicles several inches long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Narrowly campanulate;
eighteen to thirty lines long. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Two or three inches long. (Otherwise
as <i>Y. Mohavensis</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southwestern Utah to the Mojave
Desert.</p></blockquote>

<p>The traveler crossing the Mojave Desert upon the railroad
has his curiosity violently aroused by certain fantastic tree
forms that whirl by the car windows. These are the curious
Joshua-trees of the Mormons, which are called in California
tree-yucca or yucca-palm. A writer in "The Land of Sunshine"
thus aptly characterizes them: "Weird, twisted, demoniacal,
the yuccas remind me of those enchanted forests
described by Dante, whose trees were human creatures in torment.
In twisted groups or standing isolated, they may
readily be imagined specters of the plains."</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent tells us that, though found much to the eastward
of our borders, it abounds in the Mojave Desert, where
it attains its largest size and forms a belt of gaunt, straggling
forest several miles in width along the desert's western rim.</p>

<p>Its flowers appear from March to May, but are not at all
attractive, on account of their soiled white color and disagreeable,
fetid odor. "The unopened panicles form conspicuous
cones eight to ten inches long, covered with closely overlapping
white scales, often flushed with purple at the apex."</p>

<p>The seeds are gathered and used by the omnivorous Indians,
who grind them into meal, which they eat either raw or cooked
as a mush. The wood furnishes an excellent material for paper
pulp, and some years ago an English company established a
mill at Ravenna, in Soledad Pass, for its manufacture. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[ 45]</a></span>
said that several editions of a London journal were printed
upon it, but owing to the great cost of its manufacture, the
enterprise had to be abandoned.</p>

<p>The light wood is put to many uses now, and in the curio
bazaars of the south it plays a conspicuous part, made into
many small articles. By sawing round and round the trunk of
the tree, thin sheets of considerable size are procured. A
sepia reproduction of one of the old missions upon the ivory-tinted
ground of one of these combines sentiment and novelty
in a very pretty souvenir. Surgeons find these same sheets
excellent for splints, as they are unyielding in one direction and
pliable in the other; and orchardists wrap them around the
bases of their trees to protect them from the gnawing of rabbits.</p>


<h3>COMMON ELDER.</h3>

<h4><i>Sambucus glauca</i>, Nutt. Honeysuckle Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby or arborescent; often thirty feet high; with finely fissured
bark. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; petioled; pinnate. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Three to
nine; lanceolate; acuminate; serrate; two inches or so long; smooth.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Minute; two or three lines across; in large, flat, five-branched
cymes; white. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Rotate;
five-lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; alternate with the corolla lobes. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three- to
five-celled. Stigmas of same number. <i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Small;
dark blue, with a dense white bloom. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State;
common.</p></blockquote>

<p>The elder is one of our most widely distributed shrubs, and
is a familiar sight upon almost every open glade or plain. It
is especially abundant in the south. Its flower-clusters, made
up of myriads of tiny cream-white blossoms, make a showy
but delicate and lacelike mat, while its berries are beautiful
and inviting. The bears are especially appreciative of these,
and we have sometimes seen their footprints leading along a
lonely mountain road to the elder-berry bushes. The fruit is
prized by our housewives for pies and preserves, and it would
doubtless make as good wine as that of the Eastern species.</p>

<p>Among the Spanish-Californians the blossoms are known
as "sauco" and are regarded as an indispensable household
remedy for colds. They are administered in the form of a tea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[ 46]</a></span>
which induces a profuse perspiration. It is said that Dr.
Boerhaave held the elder in such reverence for the multitude
of its virtues, that he always removed his hat when he passed it.</p>

<p>In ancient times the elder was the subject of many strange
superstitions. In his interesting book, "The Folk-Lore of
Plants," Mr. Thistleton Dyer says that it was reputed to be
possessed of magic power, and that any baptized person whose
eyes had been anointed with the green juice of its inner bark
could recognize witches anywhere. Owing to these magic
properties, it was often planted near dwellings to keep away
evil spirits. By making a magic circle and standing within it
with elder-berries gathered on St. John's Night, the mystic
fern-seed could be secured which possessed the strength of
forty men and enabled one to walk invisible. This was one
of the trees suspected as having furnished wood for the Cross;
and to this day the English country people believe themselves
safe from lightning when standing under an elder, because
lightning never strikes the tree of which the Cross was made.</p>


<h3>COULTER'S SNAPDRAGON.</h3>

<h4><i>Antirrhinum Coulterianum</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to four feet high; smooth below. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear to
oval; distant. Tendril-shoots long and slender, produced mostly
below the flowers. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or violet; in densely crowded
villous-pubescent spikes, two to ten inches long. (Otherwise as <i>A.
vagans</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The flowers of this pretty snapdragon are usually white,
and the lower lip, with its great palate often dotted with dark
color, takes up the major part of the blossom. They are
sometimes violet, however, when they much resemble the
flowers of the toad-flax, but are without their long spur.</p>

<p><i>A. Orcuttianum</i>, Gray, is a similar species, but more slender,
with fewer and smaller flowers, whose lower lip is not
much larger than the upper, and whose flower-spikes are disposed
to have the tortile branchlets in their midst. This is
found near San Diego and southward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[ 47]</a></span></p>


<h3>HELIOTROPE.</h3>

<h4><i>Heliotropium Curassavicum</i>, L. Borage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Diffusely spreading; six to twelve inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
sessile; obovate to linear; an inch or two long; succulent; glaucous.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Usually white, sometimes lavender; in dense, usually two-forked
spikes. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Salver-form; border
five-lobed, with plaited sinuses; three lines across. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five.
Anthers sessile. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. Stigma umbrella-like.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This, the only species of true heliotrope common within our
borders, is widely distributed over the world. It affects the
sand of the seashore or saline soils of the interior. It is
in no way an attractive plant, as compared with our garden
heliotrope, as its flowers have a washed-out look and are not
at all fragrant, while its pale stems and foliage lack color and
character.</p>

<p>Its leaves, which contain a mucilaginous juice, are dried and
reduced to powder by the Spanish-Californians, who esteem
them very highly as a cure for the wounds of men and animals.
They blow the dry powder into the wound.</p>


<h3>HOREHOUND.</h3>

<h4><i>Marrubium vulgare</i>, Linn. Mint Family.</h4>

<p>The horehound has been introduced from Europe at various
points along our Coast, but it is now so abundant as to seem
like an indigenous plant. It has many white-woolly, square
stems, and roundish, wrinkly opposite leaves, covered beneath
with matted, white-woolly hairs. Its small, white, bilabiate
flowers are crowded in the axils of the upper leaves so densely
as to appear like whorls. It may be known from the other
members of the Mint family by its campanulate calyx with ten
strong, recurved teeth.</p>

<p>This has long been used in medicine as a tonic, and is especially
esteemed by our Spanish-Californians as a remedy for
colds and lung troubles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[ 48]</a></span></p>


<h3>WHITE EVENING PRIMROSE.</h3>

<h4><i>&#338;nothera Californica</i>, Watson. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Hoary pubescent, and more or less villous. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or so
high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblanceolate or lanceolate; sinuately toothed or irregularly
pinnatifid; two to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; turning
to rose-color; two inches across. <i>Ovary and Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Over three
inches long. <i>Calyx-lobes.</i>&mdash;One inch long; separate at the tips. (See
<i>&#338;nothera</i> for flower-structure.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Central and Southern California;
especially about the San Bernardino region; not plentiful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps the most beautiful of all our evening primroses is
this charming white species. Late in the afternoon the handsome
silvery foliage begins to show the great white, opening
moons of the fragile blossoms. Their silken texture, delicate
fragrance, and chaste look make them paramount among blossoms.</p>

<p>It is a most interesting sight to watch the opening of one
of the nodding silvery buds. I sat down by one which had
already uplifted its head. The calyx-lobes had just commenced
to part in the center, showing the white, silken corolla tightly
rolled within. It grew larger from moment to moment, when
suddenly the calyx-lobes parted with a jerk, and the petals,
freed from their bondage, quickly spread wider and wider, as
though some spirit within were forcing its way out, while one
after another the calyx-lobes were turned downward with a
quick, decisive movement. It was a wonderful exhibition of
the power of motion in plants. I could now look within and
see a magical tangle of yellow anthers delicately draped with
cobwebby ropes of pollen.</p>

<p>The stamens take a downward curve toward the lower
petal. The anthers have already opened their stores of golden
pollen before the unfurling of the buds, so that the somewhat
sticky ropes are all ready to adhere to the first moth who visits
the flower in search of the delicious and abundant nectar stored
in the depths of the long calyx-tube. The day following their
opening the blossoms begin to turn to a delicate pink, and the
calyx-lobes have a fleshlike look.</p>

<div class="image" id="f016"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f016.png">WHITE EVENING PRIMROSE&mdash;<i>&#338;nothera Californica.</i></a></p>
</div>


<h3>EVENING SNOW.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[ 50]</a></span></p>
<h4><i>Gilia dichotoma</i>, Benth. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Six inches to a foot high; erect; sparsely leaved. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
mostly entire; filiform. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Nearly sessile in the forks, or
terminal. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With cylindric tube five lines long; wholly white,
scarious, except the five filiform green ribs, continued into needle-like
lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;White; an inch or two across. Anthers linear.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the western part of the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most showy of our gilias. Miss Eastwood
writes of it: "At about four o'clock in the afternoon
<i>Gilia dichotoma</i> begins to whiten the hillside. Before expansion
the flowers are hardly noticeable; the dull pink of the
edges, which are not covered in the convolute corolla, hides
their identity and makes the change which takes place when
they unveil their radiant faces to the setting sun the more
startling. They intend to watch all night and by sunset all are
awake. In the morning they roll up their petals again when
daylight comes on, and when the sun is well up all are asleep,
tired out with the vigil of the night. The odor is most sickening....
The same flower opens several times, and grows
larger as it grows older."</p>


<h3>HEART'S-EASE.</h3>

<h4><i>Viola ocellata</i>, Torr. and Gray. Violet Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Nearly erect; six to twelve inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Cordate;
acutish; conspicuously crenate. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five to seven lines
long; the upper white within, deep brown-purple without; the others
white or yellowish, veined with purple; the lateral with a purple spot
near the base and slightly bearded on the claw. (Flower structure as
in <i>V. pedunculata</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Wooded districts from Monterey to Mendocino
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>This dainty little heart's-ease has nothing of the gay, joyous,
self-assertive look of our yellow pansy, but rather the shy,
timid mien belonging to all the creatures of the woodland. It
ventures its pretty blossoms in late spring and early summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[ 51]</a></span></p>


<h3>ICE-PLANT.</h3>

<h4><i>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</i>, L. Fig-Marigold Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Procumbent, succulent plants, covered with minute, elongated, glistening
papillæ. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Flat; ovate or spatulate; undulate-margined;
clasping. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or rose-colored; axillary; nearly sessile;
rather small. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With campanulate tube and usually five unequal
lobes. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Linear; numerous. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- to
many-celled. Stigmas five. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast and adjacent
islands from Santa Barbara southward; also in the Mojave Desert.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ice-plant spreads its broad, green leaves over the
ground, often making large rugs, which, when reddened by
the approach of drouth and glistening with small crystals, produce
a charming effect. The flat leaves of this plant are quite
unexpectedly different from those of our other species of <i>Mesembryanthemum</i>,
which are usually cylindrical or triangular.
The leaf-stems and the calyx-tube, in particular, are beautifully
jeweled with the clear, glasslike incrustation. The flesh-pink
or almost white flowers resemble small sea-anemones, with their
single row of tentacle-like petals and hollow tube powdered
with the little white anthers.</p>

<p>The plant grows so abundantly in the fields of the southern
seasides as to be a dreadful pest to the farmer, and it is very
disagreeable to walk through, as it yields up the water of its
crystals very readily, and this is said to be of an alkaline
quality, which is ruinous to shoe-leather.</p>

<p>This ice-plant grows plentifully in the chalky regions of
France, and has there been recommended for use as a food, to
be prepared like spinach. It also grows in the Canary Islands.</p>


<h3>SQUAW-GRASS. SOUR-GRASS. TURKEY-BEARD.</h3>

<h4><i>Xerophyllum tenax</i>, Nutt. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Radical leaves.</i>&mdash;Very numerous; two or three feet long; about two
lines broad; gracefully flexile; serrulate. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Two to five feet
high; with scattered leaves; bearing at top a dense raceme a foot or
two long. <i>Perianth segments.</i>&mdash;Six; spreading rotately; four or five
lines long; white. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Styles
three; filiform. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges to British Columbia; also in the
Northern Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>Often upon high ridges we notice the large clumps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[ 52]</a></span>
certain plants with long, slender, grasslike leaves, which ray out
in every direction like a fountain, and resemble a small pampas-grass
before it flowers. We naturally wonder what the plants
are, but it may be many years before our curiosity is satisfied.
Suddenly some spring we find them sending up tall blossom-shafts,
crowned with great airy plumes of pure-white flowers,
fully worthy of our long and patient waiting. After putting
forth this supreme effort of a lifetime, and maturing its seed,
the plant dies.</p>

<p>In the north, where it is sometimes very abundant, and
occupies extensive meadows, it is known as "sour-grass." The
name "squaw-grass" is also applied there, because the leaves,
which are long, wiry, and tough, are used by the Indians in the
weaving of some of their finest baskets. Baskets made from
them are particularly pliable and durable.</p>


<h3>WHITE OWL'S CLOVER.</h3>

<h4><i>Orthocarpus versicolor</i>, Greene. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Slender; seldom branching or more than six inches high. Herbage
slightly reddish. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Cleft into filiform divisions at the apex.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pure white, fading pinkish; very fragrant. Lower lip of the
corolla with three very large sacs. Folds of the throat densely bearded.
(See <i>Orthocarpus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Francisco and Marin County.</p></blockquote>

<p>During the spring the meadows about San Francisco are
luxuriantly covered with the pretty blossoms of the owl's
clover, which make snowy patches in some places. Unlike the
other species of <i>Orthocarpus</i>, this has delightfully fragrant blossoms.</p>

<p>I do not know why this plant should be accredited to the
owl and called clover, unless the quizzical-looking little blossoms
are suggestive of the wise bird. But with all his wisdom,
I doubt if he would recognize his clover.</p>

<h3>HAIRBELL. LANTERN OF THE FAIRIES.</h3>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[ 54]</a></span></p>
<h3>WHITE GLOBE-TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus albus</i>, Dougl. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;One or two feet high; branching. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Twelve to fifteen lines long; pearly
white, sometimes lavender-tinged outside; covered within with long,
silky white hairs. <i>Gland.</i>&mdash;Shallow crescent-shaped, with four transverse
scales fringed with short glandular hairs. (See <i>Calochortus</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges and Sierras, San Diego to Tehama County.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just before the oncoming of summer, our wooded hill-slopes
and cañon-sides entertain one of the most charming of flowers;
for the graceful stalks of the hairbell begin to hang out their
delicate, white satin globes. Never was flower more exquisite
in texture and fringing&mdash;never one more graceful in habit. If
fairies have need of lanterns at all, these blossoms would certainly
make very dainty globes to hold their miniature lights.</p>

<p>Wherever they grow, these flowers win instant and enthusiastic
admiration; and they have received a variety of common
names in different localities, being known as "snowy lily-bell,"
"satin-bell," "hairbell," "lantern of the fairies," and "white
globe-tulip."</p>


<h3>TOLGUACHA. LARGE-FLOWERED DATURA.</h3>

<h4><i>Datura meteloides</i>, DC. Nightshade Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southern California, and northward&mdash;at least to Stockton.</p></blockquote>

<p>The large-flowered Datura is a common plant along southern
roadsides, producing in early May its enormous white or violet-tinged
funnels, which are sometimes ten inches long. It
resembles the common Jamestown-weed, of which it is a near
relative, but may be distinguished by its large flower and its
cylindrical calyx, which is not angled. It shares with the
Jamestown-weed its narcotic poisonous qualities, and is a
famous plant among our Indians. Dr. Palmer writes that they
bruise and boil the root in water, and when the infusion thus
made is cold, they drink it to produce a stupefying effect. In
a different degree they administer it to their young dancing women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[ 56]</a></span>
as a powerful stimulant, and before going into battle the
warriors take it to produce a martial frenzy in themselves.</p>
<div class="image" id="f018"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f018.png">HAIRBELL&mdash;<i>Calochortus albus.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>By the Piutes it is called "main-oph-weep." The specific
name, <i>meteloides</i>, indicates the resemblance of this plant to
<i>Datura Metel</i>, of India.</p>


<h3>YERBA SANTA. MOUNTAIN BALM.</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>Eriodictyon glutinosum</i>, Benth. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</p>

<p>Shrubby; three to five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Thick; glutinous;
smooth above; light beneath, with prominent net-veining; three to six
inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purple, violet, or white. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six lines long; four lines across. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
alternate with the corolla-lobes. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Styles two.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Western California; common on dry hills.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bitter, aromatic leaves of the yerba santa are a highly
valued, domestic remedy for colds, and many old-fashioned
people would not be without it.</p>

<p>Dr. Bard, one of our most eminent physicians, writes of
this interesting little shrub: "It has been reserved for the
Californian Indian to furnish three of the most valuable vegetable
additions which have been made to the pharmacop&#339;ia
during the last twenty years. One, the <i>Eriodictyon glutinosum</i>,
growing profusely in our foothills, was used by them in
affections of the respiratory tract, and its worth was so appreciated
by the missionaries that they named it yerba santa, or
holy plant."</p>

<p>The other plants referred to by Dr. Bard are the <i>Rhamnus</i>,
or <i>Cascara sagrada</i>, and the <i>Grindelia</i>. In the mountains of
Mariposa County, it is known as "wild peach," probably because
the leaf somewhat resembles the peach-leaf.</p>

<p>Dr. Behr writes that considerable quantities of it are exported,
partly for medicinal purposes, and partly as a harmless
and agreeable substitute for hops in the brewing of certain
varieties of beer, especially porter.</p>

<p>In Ventura County this passes by insensible gradations into
<i>E. tomentosum</i>, Benth., and there it is difficult to distinguish
clearly between the two species.</p>

<div class="image" id="f019"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f019.png">YERBA SANTA&mdash;<i>Eriodictyon glutinosum.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p><i>E. tomentosum</i>, Benth., is found from San Diego probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[ 58]</a></span>
to Santa Barbara. This comely shrub is so disguised in its
woolly coat that one does not at first detect its close relationship
to the more common yerba santa. Its broad, oval leaves,
ribbed like the chestnut and closely notched, and its generous
clusters of unusually large violet flowers, serve to bewilder us
for the moment. The wool upon the foliage gives it a gray-green
tone, harmonizing perfectly with the violet flowers. It
is specially abundant all over the mesas by the seashore, near
San Diego.</p>


<h3>ALUM-ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Heuchera micrantha</i>, Dougl. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Stout. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; two to four inches long.
Scapes.&mdash;Often two feet high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; minute; in loose
panicles. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed; one or two lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five;
one line long; on the sinuses of the calyx. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Styles two. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges and Sierras
from Monterey to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon almost any drive or walk along a shaded road, we
may find the alum-root hanging over a mossy bank. Its large,
airy panicle is composed of minute flowers, and appears in
early summer. But it is more conspicuous for its exquisite
foliage than for its flowers. The leaves are usually mottled in
light green and richly veined in dark brown or red, and they
often turn to a rich red later in the season.</p>

<p>The root is woody and astringent, to which latter fact the
plant owes its English name, which it shares with the other
members of the genus. These are very satisfactory plants to
bring in from the woods, because they remain beautiful in
water for many weeks.</p>

<h3>CHAMISAL. CHAMISO. GREASEWOOD.</h3>

<h4><i>Adenostoma fasciculatum</i>, Hook. and Arn. Rose Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[ 60]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to twenty feet high, with gray, shreddy bark and reddish,
slender branches. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two to four lines long; linear to
awl-shaped; smooth; clustered. Stipules small; acute. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White;
two lines across; in terminal racemose panicles. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed;
with bracts below resembling another calyx; tube ten-ribbed.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten to fifteen; in clusters between
the petals. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A dry akene. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely
distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The chamisal forms a large part of the chaparral of our
mountain slopes, and when not in bloom gives to them much
the aspect imparted to the Scotch Highlands by the heather.
It is an evergreen shrub, with small clustered, needle-like
leaves. In late spring it is covered with large, feathery
panicles of tiny white blossoms, which show with particular
effectiveness against the rich olive of its foliage, and furnish
the bees with valuable honey material for a considerable season.
When interspersed with shrubs of livelier greens, it
gives to our hill-slopes and mountain-sides a wonderfully rich
and varied character. In the summer of a season when it has
flowered freely, the cinnamon-colored seed-vessels blending
with the olives of the foliage lend a rich, warm bronze to whole
hillsides, forming a charming contrast to the straw tints and
russets of grassy slopes, and adding another to the many soft
harmonies of our summer landscape. It is most abundant in
the Coast Ranges, where, in some localities, it covers mile after
mile of hill-slopes, with its close-cropped, uniform growth.</p>

<p>When the chaparral, or dense shrubby growth of our
mountain-sides, is composed entirely of <i>Adenostoma</i>, it is
called chamisal.</p>

<p>Another species, <i>A. sparsifolium</i>, Torr., found in the
south, and somewhat resembling the above, may be known
from it by its lack of stipules, its scattered, not clustered
leaves, which are obtuse and not pointed, and its somewhat
larger flowers, each one pediceled.</p>

<p>This is commonly known among the Spanish-Californians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[ 61]</a></span>
as "Yerba del Pasmo," literally the "herb of the convulsion,"
and among them and the Indians it is a sovereign remedy for
many ailments, being considered excellent for colds, cramps,
and snakebites, and an infallible cure for tetanus, or lockjaw.
The foliage fried in grease becomes a healing ointment.</p>

<p>The bark of this species is reddish and hangs in shreds.</p>


<h3>HOLLY-LEAVED CHERRY. ISLAY.</h3>

<h4><i>Prunus ilicifolia</i>, Walp. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Evergreen shrubs or small trees; eight to thirty feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
holly-like; an inch or two long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; three
lines across; in racemes eighteen lines to three inches long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; spreading. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twelve to twenty-five.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Solitary; one-celled. Style terminal. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A dark
red cherry, becoming black; six lines in diameter. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast
Ranges, San Francisco into Lower California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The holly-leaved cherry is a very ornamental shrub, with
its shining, prickly evergreen leaves, and it is coming more and
more into favor for cultivation, especially as a hedge-shrub.
In its natural state it attains its greatest perfection in the mountains
near Santa Barbara and southward. On dry hills it is
only a shrub, but in the rich soil of cañon bottoms it becomes
a tree. Some of the finest specimens are to be found in the
gardens of the old missions, where they have been growing
probably a century.</p>

<p>Dr. Behr tells us that the foliage, in withering, develops
hydrocyanic acid, the odor of which is quite perceptible. The
leaves are then poisonous to sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>The shrubs are especially beautiful in spring, after they have
made their new growth of bright green at the ends of the
branches, and put forth a profusion of feathery bloom. The
blossoms have the pleasant, bitter fragrance of the cultivated
cherry, and attract myriads of bees, who make the region
vocal with their busy hum. The fruit, which ripens from September
to December, is disappointing, owing to its very thin
pulp, though its astringent and acid flavor is not unpleasant.</p>

<p>It was used by the aborigines as food, however, and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[ 62]</a></span>
into an intoxicating drink by fermentation. The meat of the
stones ground and made into balls constituted a delicate morsel
with them.</p>


<h3>YERBA BUENA.</h3>

<h4><i>Micromeria Douglasii</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Aromatic trailing vines. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; one to four feet long.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;One inch long; round-ovate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; axillary;
white or purplish. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed; two lines long. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Five
lines long; bilabiate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in pairs on the corolla.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. Style filiform. Stigma unevenly
two-lipped. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Vancouver Island to Los Angeles County.</p></blockquote>

<p>The yerba buena is as dear to the Californian as the Mayflower
to the New Englander, and is as intimately associated
with the early traditions of this Western land as is that delicate
blossom with the stormy past of the Pilgrim Fathers. Its
delicious, aromatic perfume seems in some subtle way to link
those early days of the Padres with our own, and to call up
visions of the long, low, rambling mission buildings of adobe,
with their picturesque red-tiled roofs; the flocks and herds
tended by gentle shepherds in cowls; and the angelus sounding
from those quaint belfries, and vibrating in ever-widening
circles over hill and vale.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the Mission Fathers, the Indians used
this little herb, placing great faith in its medicinal virtues,
so that the Padres afterward bestowed upon it the name of
"yerba buena"&mdash;"the good herb." It is still used among our
Spanish-Californians in the form of a tea, both as a pleasant
beverage and as a febrifuge, and also as a remedy for indigestion
and other disorders.</p>

<p>They designate this as "Yerba Buena del Campo"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
the wild or field yerba buena,&mdash;to distinguish it from the
"Yerba Buena del Poso"&mdash;"the herb of the well,"&mdash;which is
the common garden-mint growing in damp places.</p>

<p>Aside from its associations and medicinal virtues, this is a
charming little plant. In half-shaded woods its long, graceful
stems make a trailing interlacement upon the ground and yield
up their minty fragrance as we pass.</p>

<div class="image" id="f021"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>

<h3>MATILIJA POPPY.</h3>

<h4><i>Romneya Coulteri</i>, Harv. Poppy Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[ 64]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Numerous; two to fifteen feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; the lower pinnatifid; the upper pinnately cut into long narrow
segments; glaucous; three to five inches long; smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
six to nine inches across. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Three; strongly arched,
covered with bristly appressed hairs; caducous. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Six; white.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Very numerous. Filaments filiform; yellow, purple below.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Seven- to eleven-celled. Stigmas several. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa
Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Matilija poppy (pronounced ma-til'li-ha) must be conceded
the queen of all our flowers. It is not a plant for small
gardens, but the fitting adornment of a large park, where it
can have space and light and air to rear its imperial stems
and shake out its great diaphanous flowers. It is one of the
most wonderful of wild flowers, and it is difficult to believe that
nature, without the aid of a careful gardener, should have produced
such a miracle of loveliness. It is justly far-famed, and
by English gardeners, who now grow it successfully, it is regarded
as a priceless treasure, and people go from many miles
around to see it when it blooms. It is to be regretted that
our flowers must go abroad to find their warmest admirers.</p>

<p>This plant was named in honor of Dr. Romney Robinson,
a famous astronomer. Its common name was given it because
it grows in particular abundance in the Matilija Cañon, some
miles above Ventura in the mountains. Many people have the
mistaken idea that it grows only in that region. It is not
common, by any means; but it is found in scattered localities
from Santa Barbara southward into Mexico. It is very abundant
near Riverside, and also upon the southern boundary
and below in Lower California, where the plants cover large
areas. It not only grows in fertile valleys, but seeks the seclusion
of remote cañons, and nothing more magnificent could be
imagined than a steep cañon-side covered with the great
bushy plants, thickly sown with the enormous white flowers.</p>

<div class="image" id="f022"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f022.png">MATILIJA POPPY&mdash;<i>Romneya Coulteri</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The round buds (which, however, are sometimes pointed)
are closely wrapped in three overlapping hairy sepals. These<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[ 66]</a></span>
gradually open, and at dawn the buds unfurl their crumpled
petals to the day, exhaling a pleasant fragrance. The blossoms
remain open for many days.</p>

<p>These plants have long been in use among the Indians of
Lower California, who esteem them highly for their medicinal
qualities. The seeds require a long period for germination,
and they have been known to come at the end of two years.
The better method of propagation is from root-cuttings.</p>

<p>The plant has been called "Mission poppy" and "Giant
Californian white poppy," but the pretty Indian name cannot
be improved upon.</p>


<h3>WHITE SAGE. GREASEWOOD.</h3>

<h4><i>Audibertia polystachya</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby, three to ten feet high; many-stemmed. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
lanceolate; narrowing into a petiole; several inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White
or pale lavender, in loose panicles a foot or two long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Tubular;
bilabiate. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;About six lines long, with short tube
and bilabiate border. Upper lip small; erect. Lower lip three-lobed;
the middle lobe large. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Two; jointed. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four
seedlike nutlets. Style slender. Stigma two-cleft. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara
to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The classic honey of Hymettus could not have been clearer
or more wholesome than that distilled by the bees from the
white sage of Southern California, which has become justly
world-renowned. The plants cover extensive reaches of valley
and hill-slopes, and are often called "greasewood."</p>

<p>Certain it is that the white stems have a very greasy, gummy
feel and a rank, aggressive odor. In spring the long, coarse,
sparsely leafy branches begin to rise from the woody base,
often making the slopes silvery; and by May these have fully
developed their loose, narrow panicles of pale flowers and
yellowish buds.</p>

<p>The structure of these blossoms is very interesting. The
long, prominent lower lip curves downward and upward and
backward upon itself, like a swan's neck, while the two stamens
rising from its surface lift themselves like two long horns, and
the style curves downward.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[ 67]</a></span></p>

<p>A bee arriving at this flower naturally brushes against the
stigma, leaving upon it some of the pollen gained from another
flower. Then alighting upon the lower lip, his weight bends it
downward, and he grasps the stamens as convenient handles,
thus drawing the anthers toward his body, where the pollen is
dusted upon his coat as he probes beneath the closed upper lip
for the honey in the depths of the tube. The various sages of
the south have a very interesting way of hybridizing.</p>


<h3>CASCARA SAGRADA. CALIFORNIA COFFEE.</h3>

<h4><i>Rhamnus Californica</i>, Esch. Buckthorn Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Shrubs.</i>&mdash;Four to eighteen feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; elliptic
to oblong; denticulate or entire; leathery; one to four inches long; six
to eighteen lines wide. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Clustered; greenish white; small.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; minute; on the sinuses of the
calyx; each clasping a stamen. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- to four-celled. Style
short. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Berry-like; black; four to six lines long; containing
two or three nutlets, like coffee-beans. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Long before the advent of the Spanish, the medicinal virtues
of this shrub were known to the Indians, who used it as
a remedy for rheumatism and, according to Dr. Bard, to correct
the effects of an acorn diet. The Mission Fathers afterward
came to appreciate its worth so highly that they bestowed
upon it the name <i>Cascara sagrada</i>, or the "sacred bark."
Since those early days the fame of it has spread the world
around. No more valuable laxative is known to the medical
world to-day, and every year great quantities of it are exported
from our shores. Though the shrub is found as far south as
San Diego, the bark is not gathered in any quantity south of
Monterey, as it becomes too thin southward. The shrub goes
under a variety of names, according to the locality in which it
is found.</p>

<p>In Monterey County it is known as "yellow-boy" or "yellow-root,"
and in Sonoma County it becomes "pigeon-berry,"
because the berry is a favorite food of the wild pigeons, and
lends to their flesh a bitter taste.</p>

<p>Some years ago quite an excitement prevailed in the State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[ 68]</a></span>
when some visionary persons believed they had found a perfect
substitute for coffee in the seeds of this shrub. To be sure,
they do somewhat resemble the coffee-bean in form, but the
resemblance goes no further; for upon a careful analysis they
revealed none of the qualities of coffee, nor upon roasting did
they exhale its aroma. After much discussion of the matter
and the laying out in imagination of extensive, natural coffee-plantations
upon our wild hill-slopes, these hopeful people were
destined to see their project fall in ruins.</p>

<p>This shrub is very variable, according to the locality where
it grows. Under shade, the leaves become herbaceous and
ample, and as we go northward that becomes the prevailing
type, and is then called <i>R. Purshiana</i>, DC. It is then often
very large, having a trunk the size of a man's body. In Oregon
it is known as "chittemwood" and "bitter bark," and
also as "wahoo" and "bear-wood." The <i>var. tomentella</i>,
Brew. and Wats., is densely white-tomentose, especially on the
under surfaces of the leaves.</p>


<h3>EVERLASTING FLOWER. CUDWEED.</h3>
<h3>LADY'S TOBACCO.</h3>

<h4><i>Gnaphalium decurrens</i>, Ives. Composite Family</h4>

<blockquote><p>Viscid-glandular under the loose hairs. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;In densely
crowded, flattish clusters. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; of very numerous,
scarious, yellowish-white, oval scales. (Otherwise similar to
<i>Anaphalis Margaritacea</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Diego through Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The common everlasting flower, or cudweed, is plentiful
upon our dry hills, blooming in early summer, where its white
clusters are conspicuous objects amid the drying vegetation.
In our rural districts it is believed that sleeping upon a pillow
made of these flowers will cure catarrhal affections.</p>

<p><i>G. Sprengelii</i>, Hook. and Arn., may be known from the
above by its densely gray, woolly herbage, which is not glandular-viscid.
It is also common throughout the State.</p>

<p>The beautiful edelweiss of the Alps is a species of <i>Gnaphalium</i>,
<i>G. leontopodium</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[ 69]</a></span></p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN BUCKEYE.</h3>
<h3>CALIFORNIAN HORSE-CHESTNUT.</h3>

<h4><i>Æsculus Californica</i>, Nutt. Maple or Soapberry Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or trees ten to forty feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; petioled;
with five palmate, stalked leaflets. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Oblong; acute; three to
five inches long; serrulate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; in a thyrse a foot long;
many of them imperfect. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Tubular; two-lobed. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four
or five; six lines or more long; unequal. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five to
seven; exserted. Anthers buff. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. <i>Nuts.</i>&mdash;One
to three inches in diameter; usually one in the pod. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast
Ranges of Middle California; also the Sierra foothills.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our Californian buckeye is closely allied to the horse-chestnuts
and buckeyes of the eastern half of the continent.
It is usually found upon stream-banks or the side-walls of
cañons, and reaches its greatest perfection in the valleys of our
central Coast Ranges. It usually branches low into a number
of clean, round, light-gray limbs, which widen out into a
broad, dense, rounded head. Its leaves are fully developed
before the flowers appear. When in full bloom, in May, it is
considered one of the most beautiful of all our American
species. Its long, white flower-spikes, sprinkled rather regularly
over the green mound of foliage, are very suggestive of a
neat calico print. Early to come, the leaves are as early to
depart, and by midsummer the beautiful skeleton is often bare,
its interlacing twigs making a delicate network against the deep
azure of the sky.</p>

<p>Though lavish in its production of flowers, usually but one
or two of the large cluster succeed in maturing fruit. By October
and November the leathery pods begin to yield up their
big golden-brown nuts, which are great favorites among the
squirrels. The Indians are said to resort to these nuts in times
of famine. Before using them, they roast them a day or two
in the ground, to extract the poison.</p>

<p>The inner wood of the root, after being kiln-cured for several
weeks, becomes very valuable to the cabinet-maker. It is
then of an exquisite mottled green, and when highly polished
can hardly be distinguished from a fine piece of onyx.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[ 70]</a></span></p>


<h3>PUSSY'S-PAWS.</h3>

<h4><i>Spraguea umbellata</i>, Torr. Purslane Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Spatulate or oblanceolate; six lines to four inches
long. <i>Stem-leaves.</i>&mdash;Similar, but smaller, often reduced to a few
bracts. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Several; two to twelve inches high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In
dense spikes. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two; orbicular; thin; papery; two to four
lines across; whitish; equaling the petals. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; rose-color.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style bifid. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Sierras, from the Yosemite to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pussy's-paws is a very plentiful plant in the Sierras, usually
growing upon dry, rocky soil. It varies much in aspect,
sometimes sending up a stout, erect flower-scape, and again
growing low and matlike with its prostrate flower-stems radiating
from the center. It blooms from early summer onward,
often almost covering the ground with its blossoms. The
flower-clusters grow in a bunch, much like the pink cushions
on pussy's feet, whence the pretty common name.</p>


<h3>SPANISH BAYONET. OUR LORD'S CANDLE.</h3>

<h4><i>Yucca Whipplei</i>, Torr. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Without a trunk. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical in a bristling hemisphere;
sword-like. <i>Flower-panicles.</i>&mdash;Distaff-shaped; three or more feet
long; at the summit of a leafless bracteate scape, ten or fifteen feet
high. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Rotately spreading; waxen-white (sometimes rich
purple), often green- or purple-nerved. <i>Filaments.</i>&mdash;Clavate; pure
white. Anthers transverse; yellow. Style very thick; three-angled.
Stigma stalked; green; covered with tiny prominences. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A
dry capsule. (Structure otherwise as in <i>Y. Mohavensis</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Monterey
to San Diego and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spring and early summer the chaparral-covered hillsides
of Southern California present a wonderful appearance when
hundreds of these Spanish bayonets are in bloom. From day to
day the waxen tapers on the distant slopes increase in height as
the white bells climb the slender shafts. At length each cluster
reaches its perfection, and becomes a solid distaff of sometimes
two&mdash;yes, even six&mdash;thousand of the waxen blossoms!</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f023.png">PUSSY'S-PAWS&mdash;<i>Spraguea umbellata</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>A friend writing of them, once said: "Nearly every poetaster
in the country has sung the praises of the yellow poppies
and the sweet little <i>Nemophilas</i>, but not one, so far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[ 72]</a></span>
know, has ever written a stanza to these grand white soldiers
and their hundred swords." There is, indeed, something
glorious and warlike about them, as they marshal themselves
to the defense of our hillsides.</p>

<p>This surpasses all known species in the height and beauty
of its flower-panicles; but, once the season of flowering and
fruiting has been consummated, its life mission is fulfilled, and
the plant dies. The dead stalks remain standing sometimes
for years upon the mountain-sides.</p>

<p>The seeds of this species, as well as those of the tree-yucca,
are made into flour by the Indians; and from the leaves they
obtain a soft, white fiber, which they use in making the linings
of the coarse saddle-blankets they weave from <i>Yucca Mohavensis</i>.
The undeveloped flowering shoots they consider a great
delicacy, either raw or prepared as mescal. They gather
great numbers of the plants when just at the right stage,
and strip off the leaves, leaving round masses. These they
prepare after the manner of a clam-bake, and when the
pile is pulled to pieces and the mescal is taken out, it has a
faint resemblance to a baked sweet apple, and is of about the
same consistency. The whole mass is a mixture of sweet, soft
pulp and coarse white fibers much like manilla rope-yarn.</p>


<h3>RUBY LILY. CHAPARRAL LILY. REDWOOD LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium rubescens</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<h4><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from Marin County to Humboldt County.</h4>

<p>This is the most charming of all our Californian lilies, even
surpassing in loveliness the beautiful Washington lily; and it
is said to be the most fragrant of any in the world. It resembles
the Washington lily; but its flowers are fuller in form,
with wider petals and shorter tube, and it has a smaller bulb.
It sends up a noble shaft, sometimes seven feet high, with
many scattered whorls of undulate leaves, and often bears at
the summit as many as twenty-five of the beautiful flowers.
These are at first pure white, dotted with purple, but they soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[ 74]</a></span>
take on a metallic luster and begin to turn to a delicate pink,
which gradually deepens into a ruby purple. Mr. Purdy mentions
having seen a plant with a stalk nine feet high, bearing
thirty-six flowers.</p>

<div class="image" id="f024"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f024.png">RUBY LILY&mdash;<i>Lilium rubescens</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The favorite haunts of this lily are high and inaccessible
ridges, among the chaparral, or under the live-oak or redwood.
Comparatively few people know of its existence, though living
within a few miles of it, because they rarely ever visit these
out-of-the-way fastnesses of nature.</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs has somewhere said: "Genius is a specialty;
it does not grow in every soil, it skips the many and
touches the few; and the gift of perfume to a flower is a special
grace, like genius or like beauty, and never becomes common
or cheap." Certainly these blossoms have been richly endowed
with this charming gift, and their delicious fragrance
wafted by the wind often betrays their presence upon a hillside
when unsuspected before, so that one skilled in woodcraft can
often trace them by it.</p>


<h3>THISTLE-POPPY. CHICALOTE.</h3>

<h4><i>Argemone platyceras</i>, Link and Otto. Poppy Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to two and one half feet high; hispid throughout, or
armed with rigid bristles or prickles. Sap yellow. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Thistle-like;
three to six inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; two to four inches in
diameter. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Three; spinosely beaked. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four to six.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. Filaments slender. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Oblong; one-celled.
Stigma three- or four-lobed. Capsule very prickly. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry
hillsides from Central California southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The thistle-poppy would be considered in any other country
a surpassingly beautiful flower, with its large diaphanous white
petals and its thistly gray-green foliage, but in California it
must yield precedence to the Matilija poppy. It resembles the
latter very closely in its flower, and is often mistaken for it. It
may be known by its yellow juice, its prickly foliage, and its
very prickly capsules. I believe the flowers are somewhat
more cup-shaped than those of <i>Romneya</i>.</p>

<p>It affects dry hill-slopes and valleys, often otherwise barren,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[ 75]</a></span>
where it grows luxuriantly, and sometimes attains a height of
six feet, being in full bloom in May. There, where one is
unprepared for such a sight, it becomes an object of startling
beauty.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h3><i>Malacothrix saxatilis</i>, Torr. and Gray. Composite Family.</h3>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; a foot or two high; woody. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate
to spatulate; one or two inches long; entire or pinnatifid; somewhat
succulent. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Terminating the paniculate branches; large;
two inches or so across; white, changing to rose or lilac; of ray-flowers
only. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Campanulate or hemispherical; six lines high, with
many imbricated scales passing downward into loose, awl-shaped
bracts. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from Santa Barbara southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This beautiful plant is a dweller upon the ocean cliffs, and
may be seen in abundance from the car-windows just before
the train reaches Santa Barbara going north. The stems are
woody and very leafy, and the plants are usually covered all
over the top with the showy flower-heads.</p>

<p><i>M. tenuifolia</i>, Torr. and Gray, is a very tall, slender,
sparsely leafy plant with fragile, airy white flowers. This is
common along the dusty roadsides of the south in early
summer.</p>


<h3>SALAL. WINTERGREEN.</h3>

<h4><i>Gaultheria Shallon</i>, Pursh. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby, and one to three or more feet high or prostrate. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
short-petioled; ovate to elliptical; pointed; two to four
inches long; leathery; bristle-toothed when young; evergreen. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Manzanita-like;
slenderer; glandular-viscid; white or pinkish. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled.
Style single. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Black; berry-like; aromatic;
edible. (Otherwise like <i>Arctostaphylos Manzanita</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast
woods, from Santa Barbara County to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The floor of the redwood forest in our northern coast
counties is often carpeted with this little undershrub, while in
other places one can wade waist-deep in it. It grows much
larger north of us, and upon Vancouver Island it forms dense,
impenetrable thickets. Its dark-purple berries have a very
agreeable flavor, and form an important article of diet among
the Oregon Indians, who call them "salal." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[ 76]</a></span></p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN SPIKENARD.</h3>

<h4><i>Aralia Californica</i>, Wats. Ginseng Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;Thick; aromatic. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Eight to ten feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Bipinnate;
or the upper pinnate, with one or two pairs of leaflets.
<i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Cordate-ovate; four to eight inches long; serrate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White;
two lines long; in globular umbels, arranged in loose panicles
a foot or two long. Pedicels four to six lines long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed
or entire. <i>Petals and Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- to
five-celled. Styles united to the middle. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A purple berry.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed; on stream-banks.</p></blockquote>

<p>In moist, cool ravines, where the sun only slants athwart
the branches and a certain dankness always lingers, the Californian
spikenard scents the air with its peculiar odor. It
closely resembles <i>A. racemosa</i> of the Eastern States, but it is
a larger, coarser plant in every way. It throws up its tall
stems with a fine confidence that there will be ample space for
its large leaves to spread themselves uncrowded. Its feathery
panicles of white flowers are followed by clusters of small purple
berries, and are rather more delicate than we should expect
from so large a plant.</p>


<h3>YERBA MANSA.</h3>

<h4><i>Anemopsis Californica</i>, Hook. Yerba Mansa Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Rootstock creeping. <i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Long-petioled; elliptic oblong;
two to ten inches long. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to two feet high.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Without sepals and petals, sunk in a conical spike; six to
eighteen lines long; a small white bract under each flower. <i>Spikes.</i>&mdash;Subtended
by from five to eight white petal-like bracts, six to fifteen
lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three to eight. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Apparently one-celled.
Stigmas one to five. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southern to Central California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as the fervid glow of the sun is beginning to transform
the green of our southern hill-slopes to soft browns, the still
vividly green lowland meadows suddenly bring forth myriads
of white stars, which in their green setting become grateful
resting-points for the eye. These are the blossoms of the
famous <i>Yerba Mansa</i> of the Spanish-Californians. Among
these people the plant is an infallible remedy for many disorders,
and so highly do they prize it, that they often travel or
send long distances for it.</p>

<div class="image" id="f025"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f025.png">YERBA MANSA&mdash;<i>Anemopsis Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The aromatic root, which has a strong, peppery taste, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[ 78]</a></span>
very astringent, and when made into a tea or a powder, is
applied with excellent results to cuts and sores. The tea
is also taken as a blood-purifier; and the plant, in the form of
a wash or poultice, is used for rheumatism, while the wilted
leaves are said to reduce swellings. In the medical world it is
beginning to be used in diseases of the mucous membrane.</p>


<h3>SHEPHERD'S PURSE.</h3>

<h4><i>Capsella Bursa-pastoris</i>, Medic. Mustard Family.</h4>

<p>Among our commonest and most harmless weeds is the
shepherd's purse, which has been introduced from Europe in
the past. It may be easily recognized by its tiny white cruciferous
flowers and its shapely little triangular, flat pods, which
have a peppery taste. It is used medicinally, and valued as a
remedy for many different maladies. In Europe, a common
name for the plant is "mother's heart," and Mr. Johnston says
that children play a sort of game with the seed-pouch. "They
hold it out to their companions, inviting them to 'take a haud
o' that.' It immediately cracks, and then follows a triumphant
shout, 'You've broken your mother's heart!'"</p>

<p>Equally common is the <i>Lepidium</i>, or pepper-grass, the
small round, flat pods of which also have a peppery taste.
Both of these belong to the great Mustard family.</p>


<h3>MARIPOSA TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus venustus</i>, Benth. (and varieties). Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or two high; branching. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Narrow; grasslike;
channeled; glaucous; decumbent. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Erect; cup-shaped;
white, lilac, pink, claret, magenta, purple, or rarely light yellow; of uniform
color or shaded; plain or variously oculated, stained, or blotched.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;One or two inches long; slightly hairy below. <i>Gland.</i>&mdash;Large;
roundish; densely hairy. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate; four or five lines
broad. (See <i>Calochortus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry sandy soil, in the Coast Ranges
and Sierra foothills, from Mendocino County to Los Angeles.</p></blockquote>

<p>I once emerged from the dense chaparral of a steep hillside
upon a grassy slope, where myriads of these lovely flowers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[ 80]</a></span>
tossed their delicate cups upon the breeze. As I passed from
flower to flower, I noticed many insect guests regaling themselves
upon the nectar. Bees and flies jostled one another
and crawled amid the hairs below, and beautifully mottled
butterflies hovered over them.</p>

<div class="image" id="f026"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f026.png">MARIPOSA TULIP&mdash;<i>Calochortus venustus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>As originally described, this flower was white or pale lilac,
with a more or less conspicuous, usually reddish, stain, or
blotch, near the top, a brownish spot bordered with yellow in
the center, and a brownish striate base. But it varies so widely
from this type, in both color and spots, that neither is a reliable
character from which to determine the species. Some of the
oculated forms of <i>C. luteus</i> are so similar that they are readily
confused with this, but a careful examination of the gland and
the form of the capsule, together with the character of the soil
in which the plants grow, will identify the species.</p>


<h3>COMMON NIGHTSHADE.</h3>

<h4><i>Solanum nigrum</i>, L. Nightshade Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Along streams near the coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>This may be easily distinguished from <i>S. Xanti</i> by its very
small white flowers, whose corollas are but three or four lines
across, and much more deeply and pointedly lobed, the lobes
having a tendency to turn backward as the flowers grow older;
also by its thinner, duller leaves, and much smaller, black berries,
the size of peas.</p>

<p>It is considered a violent narcotic poison, both berries and
leaves having caused death when eaten. It is used in the medical
world, in the form of a tincture for various maladies, and
it is said that in Bohemia the blossoming plant is hung over the
cradles of infants to induce sweet slumber; while in Dalmatia
the root is fried in butter and eaten to produce sleep, and is
also used as remedy for hydrophobia.</p>

<p><i>Solanum Douglasii</i>, Dunal, is a similar species, with larger
flowers, which are usually white, though sometimes light blue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[ 81]</a></span></p>


<h3>BUTTERFLY TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus luteus, var. oculatus</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Sierras and Coast Ranges, from Fresno County to Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all our lovely Mariposa tulips, this charming form is
perhaps the most like the insect for which it is named. Its
creamy or purplish flowers have an exquisitely tinted dark-maroon
eye, surrounded by yellow, and it is often streaked in
marvelous imitation of the insect's wing. It was doubtless
this form Miss Coolbrith had in mind when she wrote the beautiful
lines below:</p>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"Insect or blossom? Fragile, fairy thing,</span>
<span class="ni">Poised upon slender tip and quivering</span>
<span class="ni">To flight! a flower of the fields of air;</span>
<span class="ni">A jeweled moth, a butterfly with rare</span>
<span class="ni">And tender tints upon his downy wing</span>
<span class="ni">A moment resting in our happy sight;</span>
<span class="ni">A flower held captive by a thread so slight</span>
<span class="ni">Its petal-wings of broidered gossamer</span>
<span class="ni">Are, light as the wind, with every wind astir,</span>

<h3>WESTERN BOYKINIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Boykinia occidentalis</i>, Torr. and Gray. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; a foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Round-reniform;
palmately three- to seven-lobed; one to three inches broad; the lobes
coarsely toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In long-peduncled, loose panicles; white;
four lines across; parts in fives. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With acute teeth. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;On
the sinuses of the calyx. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;On the calyx, opposite its
teeth. Filaments short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;With its two cells attenuate into the
slender styles. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges, from Santa Barbara to Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tufted leaves, and exquisitely delicate saxifrage-like
clusters of the <i>Boykinia</i>, fringe our streams in early summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[ 82]</a></span></p>


<h3>SOAP-PLANT. AMOLE.</h3>

<h4><i>Chlorogalum pomeridianum</i>, Kunth. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulb.</i>&mdash;One to four inches in diameter; densely brown-fibrous.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen inches long. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;One to five feet high;
bearing a loosely spreading panicle. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;White; of six spreading,
recurved segments nine lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; shorter than
the segments. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style filiform. Stigma three-lobed.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The leaves of the soap-plant have been with us all the
spring, increasing in length as the season has advanced. You
can easily recognize them, as they resemble a broad, wavy-margined
grass, usually lying flat upon the ground, with some
of the ragged brown fibres of the bulb showing aboveground,
like the fragment of an old manilla mat.</p>

<p>In early summer, from their midst begins to shoot a slender
stalk. When the process of its growth is complete, it stands
from two to five feet high, with slender, widespreading
branches and rather sparsely scattered flowers.</p>

<p>If you would find its flowers open, you must seek it in the
afternoon. At a little distance, it appears as though the truant
summer wind had lodged a delicate white feather here and
there upon the branches. In themselves, these blossoms are
not ill-favored, with their slender, recurved petals; but to us
the root is the most interesting part of the plant. This the
early Spanish-Californians used extensively in lieu of soap, and
esteemed greatly as a hair tonic, and it was known by them
as "amole." Even now it is much used among their descendants,
and we know of one aged señora over ninety who refuses
to use anything else for washing. Her grandsons keep her
supplied with the bulbs, which they dig by the sackful from
the neighboring hill-slopes and mesas. She takes her linen
down to the brookside, and there, in primitive fashion, upon
her knees she scours and rinses it till it is as white as the driven
snow.</p>

<div class="image" id="f027"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f027.png">SOAP-PLANT&mdash;<i>Chlorogalum pomeridianum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Indians of the Sierra foothills have a curious use for
the bulb. After the June freshets have subsided, many fish
are usually left in small pools in the streams. The squaws go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[ 84]</a></span>
to these pools with an abundance of soap-root, and kneeling
upon the banks, rub up a great suds with it. The fish soon
rise to the surface stupefied, and are easily taken.</p>

<p>We are told that in the early days of the gold excitement,
when commodities were scarce and brought fabulous prices,
the fibrous outer coats of the bulb were used for stuffing
mattresses.</p>

<p>The inner portion of the bulb, when reduced to a paste, is
said to be an excellent remedy for oak-poisoning, applied as a
salve.</p>

<p>This is not the only plant popularly known as soap-plant
among us. Several others share the title, among them the
goose-foot, the yucca, and the California lilac. There are
several other species of <i>Chlorogalum</i>.</p>


<h3>MOUNTAIN BIRCH. WHITE TEA-TREE. SOAP-BUSH.</h3>

<h4><i>Ceanothus integerrimus</i>, Hook. and Arn. Buckthorn Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or small trees; five to twelve feet high; with cylindrical,
usually warty, branches. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; on slender petioles two
to six lines long; ovate to ovate-oblong; one to three inches long;
entire or rarely slightly glandular-serrulate; thin. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White;
sometimes blue; in a thyrse three to seven inches long, one to four
thick. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Not crested. (See <i>Ceanothus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mountains
from Los Angeles to the Columbia River.</p></blockquote>

<p>When in flower, this is one of the most attractive of all our
<i>Ceanothi</i>. It often covers great mountain-sides with its white
bloom as with drifted snow. The trip to the Yosemite is
often diversified by this beautiful spectacle, which comes as an
exhilarating surprise.</p>

<p>Among the mountaineers this shrub is highly valued as
forage for their cattle, which they turn upon it after the lowland
pastures have dried up.</p>

<p>The young twigs and leaves have the spicy fragrance of the
black birch of the Eastern States. The foliage is deciduous,
and of rather a pale though bright green. The bark of the
root of this shrub is becoming celebrated as a remedy for various
disorders, such as malaria, catarrh, and liver trouble.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[ 85]</a></span></p>


<h3>COMMON WHITE LUPINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Lupinus densiflorus</i>, Benth. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; simple below; parted in the middle into numerous
widespreading branches; two feet high; succulent; sparsely villous.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In long-peduncled racemes; six to ten inches long; with
usually five or six dense whorls. Bracts bristle-like, from a broad base.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Upper lip scarious; deeply cleft; lower long, toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;White
or rose-color; seven lines or so long; the standard dark
dotted. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Two-seeded. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widespread; Sacramento Valley
southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the days when we went fishing in the brook with a pin
for minnows, a company of these pretty white lupines in a
field represented to our childish fancy so many graceful dames
in flounced skirts dancing in a sylvan ballroom.</p>


<h3>MEADOW-SWEET.</h3>

<h4><i>Spiræa discolor</i>, Pursh. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled;
an inch or two long; oval or ovate; crenately lobed above; the lobes
often toothed; silky pubescent beneath. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; two lines
across; in feathery panicles several inches long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted;
petaloid. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; equaling the sepals. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;About
twenty. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Five; distinct; one-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges,
mostly from Monterey County northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not until midsummer is upon us does the common meadow-sweet
make itself noticeable by its large feathery clusters of
minute white flowers, which have a pleasant odor, reminiscent
of slippery-elm.</p>

<p>We have two species of <i>Spiræa</i> with pink flowers&mdash;<i>S.
Douglasii</i>, Hook., the Californian hardhack, having its blossoms
in long clusters, (found in Northern California,) and <i>S.
betulifolia</i>, Pall., having flat-topped flower-clusters, (found in
the Sierras).</p>

<p>Another shrub closely resembling the <i>Spiræas</i> is <i>Neillia
opulifolia</i>, Benth. and Hook., the wild bridal-wreath, or ninebark.
Indeed, this has been classed by some authorities
among the <i>Spiræas</i>. It may be easily recognized by its
hemispherical clusters of white flowers. These clusters are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[ 86]</a></span>
an inch or two across. Though the shrub is quite showy
when in bloom, it is almost equally attractive when its carpels
are beginning to redden.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN AZALEA.</h3>

<h4><i>Rhododendron occidentale</i>, Gray. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to twelve feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Clustered at the ends of
the branches; obovate to lanceolate; two to four inches long; herbaceous.
<i>Flower-clusters.</i>&mdash;Large, from a special terminal bud. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply
five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With funnel-form tube, and five-cleft
border; white; the upper lobe blotched with corn-color; sometimes
tinged with pink; glandular-viscid without. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. Anthers
two-celled, opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Very
woody. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Stream-banks throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most deservedly admired of all our shrubs is the
lovely Californian azalea. In June and July, the borders of
our mountain streams are covered for miles with the bushes,
whose rich green foliage is often almost obscured from view by
the magnificent clusters of white and yellow, or sometimes
pinkish, flowers. Its delicious, spicy perfume is always subtly
suggestive of charming days spent with rod and line along
cool streams, or of those all too brief outings spent far from
the haunts of men, in some sequestered mountain-cabin among
redwood groves or by rushing waters.</p>

<p>In Oregon it is commonly known as "honeysuckle," and
there in the autumn its life ebbs away in a flood of glory,
showering the forest floor with flecks of scarlet and crimson.
Its root is said to contain a strong narcotic poison, and the
leaves are also reputed to be poisonous if eaten, but they are
not at all harmful to the touch.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN BARRENWORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Vancouveria parviflora</i>, Greene. Barberry Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[ 88]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One or two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; twice to
thrice ternately compound. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;One to two inches broad; rich
shining green; persisting; undulate and membrane-margined. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Twenty-five
to fifty, in loose panicles; small; with six to nine sepal-like
bracts. Parts in sixes all in front of one another. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Petaloid;
two lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;White to lavender. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Erect;
closely appressed to the pistil. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style stoutish.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges of Central California.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is no more exquisite plant in our coast woods than
the American barrenwort. Its delicate threadlike stems, which
are yet strong and wiry, hold up its spreading evergreen
leaves, every leaflet in its own place. There is a likeness in
these leaves to the fronds of our Californian maidenhair, and
one could easily imagine the maidenhair amplified, strengthened,
and polished into this form. The leaflets are also somewhat
ivy-like in form.</p>

<p>In June its delicate, airy panicles of small white blossoms
appear. These are especially interesting as belonging to the
Barberry family, where all the floral organs stand in front of
one another, and the anthers open by cunningly contrived
little uplifting valves. These plants are said to grow upon
bushy hillsides, in masses sometimes several feet across. But
I have never seen it with other than an exclusive and rather
solitary habit, growing in shaded forests. We have one or
two other species.</p>


<h3>SERVICE-BERRY. JUNE-BERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Amelanchier alnifolia</i>, Nutt. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Deciduous shrubs, three to eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; from rounded to oblong-ovate; serrate usually only toward
the apex; six to eighteen lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White, in short
racemes. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; limb five-parted. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five;
oblong; six lines or so long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twenty; short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three- to
five-celled. Styles three to five. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Small; berry-like;
dark purple. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State and northward; also
eastward to the Western States.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f029"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f029.png">AMERICAN BARRENWORT&mdash;<i>Vancouveria parviflora</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The service-berry seems to be at home throughout our
borders, but it reaches its greatest perfection north of us, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[ 90]</a></span>
the rich bottom-lands of the Columbia River. In spring the
bushes are beautiful, when snowily laden with masses of ragged
white flowers; and from June to September they are no less
welcome, when abundantly hung with the black berries, which
usually have a bloom upon them. These berries are an important
article of food among our Western Indians, who make
annual pilgrimages to the regions of their growth, gathering
and drying large quantities for winter use. The drying they
effect by crushing them to a paste, which they spread upon
bark or stones in the sun. It is said that many a party of
explorers, lost in the woods, has been kept alive by this little
fruit.</p>

<p>Almost the same shrub in the Atlantic States is called
"shad-bush," because it blooms at about the season when the
shad are running up the streams.</p>


<h3>CHRISTMAS-BERRY. CALIFORNIAN HOLLY. TOYON.</h3>

<h4><i>Heteromeles arbutifolia</i>, R&#339;mer. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs four to twenty-five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled;
oblong; serrate; leathery; two to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small;
white; four lines across; in dense terminal panicles. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; roundish; spreading. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
on the calyx. Filaments awl-shaped; flat. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Two; one-celled.
Styles slender. <i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Red; four lines in diameter; in
large clusters. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges, from San Diego to Mendocino
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>Christmas could hardly be celebrated among us without our
beautiful Californian holly. Florists' windows and the baskets
of street-venders at that season are gay with the magnificent
clusters of rich cardinal berries, which are really ripe by
Thanksgiving. The common name, "Californian holly,"
refers more to the berries than to the leaves, as the latter have
not the form of holly-leaves. We have often seen the venders
mix the berries with the prickly foliage of the live-oak, to make
them seem more like holly.</p>

<p>The large clusters of spicy white flowers appear in July and
August. Nothing in all our flora yields a finer contrast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[ 91]</a></span>
lavish scarlet against rich green. The berries have a rather
pleasant taste, somewhat acid and astringent, and are eaten by
the Indians with great relish. The Spanish-Californians used
them in the preparation of an agreeable drink.</p>

<p>This is a very handsome shrub in cultivation.</p>


<h3>VIRGIN'S BOWER. CLEMATIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Clematis ligusticifolia</i>, Nutt. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Nearly smooth. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Woody; sometimes climbing thirty feet.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; long-petioled; five-foliolate. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Ovate to
lanceolate; eighteen lines to three inches long; three-lobed and
coarsely toothed; rarely entire or three-parted. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Di&#339;cious;
in axillary panicles. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Four; petaloid; four to six lines long;
thin. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Wanting. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Many; becoming
long-tailed, silky akenes. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The virgin's bower usually looks down upon us from among
the branches of some tree, where it entwines itself indistinguishably
with the foliage of its host. It climbs by means of
the stalks of its leaflets, which wrap themselves about small
twigs. This species is not so noticeable during the season of
its blossoming as it is later, when the long plumes of its seed
have twisted themselves into silvery balls, making feathery
masses. Mrs. Blochman writes that among the Spanish-Californians,
it is called "yerba de chivato," and valued as a
remedy for barbed-wire cuts in animals. It is used in the
form of a wash, and remarkable cures are effected.</p>

<p>Another widespread species&mdash;<i>C. lasiantha</i>, Nutt.&mdash;is far
more showy than the above. It is found in the Coast Ranges,
from Los Angeles to Napa County at least, and in the Sierras
to Plumas County. Its long-peduncled flowers are solitary;
but they are so numerous and grow so closely together, that
they make dense masses of white, conspicuous at a long distance.
The flowers are larger, the sepals being an inch long,
and covered with a silky pubescence, which makes them like
soft cream-colored velvet. The three ovate leaflets are also
silky.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[ 92]</a></span></p>


<h3>LADIES' TRESSES.</h3>

<h4><i>Spiranthes Romanzoffianum</i>, Cham. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Roots.</i>&mdash;Fascicled tubers. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; four to eighteen inches
high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong-lanceolate to linear. <i>Spikes.</i>&mdash;One to even
ten inches long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Yellowish white; four lines long. Upper
sepal and two petals coherent. Lip recurved, bearing a small protuberance
on each side at base. <i>Anther.</i>&mdash;On the face of the short
column. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Through the mountains from
Los Angeles northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The twisted spikes of these little orchids are interesting,
because their ranks remain so clearly defined as they wind
about the stem. The plants vary greatly in different seasons
as to size, and are usually found in moist places.</p>


<h3>TARWEED. MOUNTAIN MISERY.</h3>

<h4><i>Chamæbatia foliolosa</i>, Benth. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby; a foot or two high; branching freely; glandular pubescent
throughout; fragrant. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; finely dissected; ovate or
oblong in outline; two or three inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; few in
terminal cymes. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-lobed. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; spreading;
three or four lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Very numerous; short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Solitary.
Style terminal. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A leathery akene. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Sierras, from Mariposa County to Nevada County.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most conspicuous plants to be met on the way
to the Yosemite is the <i>Chamæbatia</i>. It is exceedingly abundant,
covering considerable areas and filling the air with its
balsamic fragrance, strongly suggestive of tansy, though to
many not so agreeable as the latter. It is a beautiful plant,
with its feathery leaves and strawberry-like flowers; but by
the roadside, where its viscid leaves and stems have caught the
dust, it is often but a travesty of itself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Brandegee writes of it: "Along the line of the railroad
in Placer County it is often called 'bear-clover,' perhaps in
accordance with our felicitous custom of giving names, because
it bears not the least resemblance to clover, and the bear will
have nothing to do with it."</p>

<h3>LARGE-FLOWERED DOGWOOD.</h3>

<h4><i>Cornus Nuttallii</i>, Audubon. Dogwood Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[ 94]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Shrubs or trees, fifteen to seventy feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
obovate; acute at each end; three to five inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Numerous;
small; greenish; in a head surrounded by an involucre of
four to six large, yellowish or white bracts, often tinged with red, and
eighteen lines to three inches long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Four-toothed. <i>Petals
and Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Scarlet; five or
six lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges and Sierras, from Monterey
and Plumas Counties to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our large-flowered dogwood more nearly resembles the
Eastern <i>C. florida</i> than any other species, but it is a much
handsomer shrub than the latter. It reaches its maximum
size in Northern Oregon and Washington, where, in the season
of its blossoming, it is a sight never to be forgotten. Its
masses of large white flowers, like single Cherokee roses, contrast
finely with the deep, rich greens of the fir forests, in
which it often grows. In its northern range, its leaves turn
beautifully, and it becomes one of the most brilliant masqueraders
in the autumn pageant.</p>

<p>The wood is very hard, close-grained, and tough, and is
used as a substitute for boxwood in the making of bobbins
and shuttles for weaving, and also in cabinet-work.</p>


<h3>MILK-WHITE REIN-ORCHIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Habenaria leucostachys</i>, Wats. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;A fusiform tuber. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to four feet high; leafy
throughout. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate; diminishing upward. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright
white, in a spike. <i>Perianth segments.</i>&mdash;Two or three lines
long. <i>Lip.</i>&mdash;Four lines long, with a slender spur four to six lines long.
<i>Anther.</i>&mdash;On the column just above the stigma. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mountains throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>From July to September we may look for the milk-white
rein-orchis in moist meadows. It is especially abundant in
the Sierras, where its charmingly fragrant, pure-white spikes
are particularly effective against the lush green of the alpine
meadows.</p>

<h3>JAMESTOWN-WEED. JIMSON-WEED. THORN-APPLE.
COMMON STRAMONIUM.</h3>

<h4><i>Datura Stramonium</i>, L. Nightshade Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[ 96]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two or three feet high; stout. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; ovate;
coarsely angled; long-petioled. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In the forks of the stem;
short-pediceled; white. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Tubular; angled; five-toothed; over
an inch long. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Funnel-form; three inches long; with an expanded
five-angled border. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; included. Filaments
long and slender; adnate to the corolla below. Style long. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled;
each cell nearly divided again. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Larger than a
walnut; prickly. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Waste grounds near habitations; introduced.</p></blockquote>

<p>The jimson-weed, which is a native of Asia, has become
quite common in waste places. It is a rank, ill-smelling, nauseating
weed, possessing narcotic, poisonous qualities, but its
flowers are rather large and showy. The leaves and seeds
are made into the drug called "stramonium," which is used
as a remedy in neuralgia, spasmodic cough, and other disorders.</p>

<p>As the plant usually grows by roadsides or in the vicinity
of dwellings, children are not infrequently poisoned by its fruit
and leaves. The poison manifests itself in dryness of the
throat, rapid pulse, and delirium; and even death may ensue,
preceded by convulsions and coma.</p>

<p>This plant is also called "mad-apple," "apple of Peru,"
and "Devil's apple."</p>

<p>It has a near relative&mdash;<i>D. suaveolens</i>, HBK.,&mdash;a large
shrub with dark-green leaves and very large, pendulous white
flowers. This is common in Californian gardens, and is known
popularly as "floriponda," or "angels' trumpets." It sheds a
powerful fragrance upon the air at night, which is not noticeable
by day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[ 97]</a></span></p>


<h3>YARROW. MILFOIL.</h3>

<h4><i>Achillea Millefolium</i>, L. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; sessile; twice-pinnately
parted into fine linear, acute, three- to five-cleft lobes;
lanceolate in outline; two to four inches long; strong-scented. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Crowded
in a flat cluster; white, sometimes pink; four lines
across, including the rays; made up of white disk-flowers and obovate
white rays. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;All around the Northern Hemisphere.</p></blockquote>

<p>The yarrow, which is a common weed in most countries
of the Northern Hemisphere, has long been known to botanists
and herbalists, and was formerly in high repute for its many
virtues. The leaves steeped in hot water are still considered
very healing applications to cuts or bruises; and among the
Spanish-Californians the fresh plants are used for stanching the
blood in recent wounds.</p>

<p>This plant received the name <i>Achillea</i>, because the great
hero of the Trojan war was supposed to have been the first to
discover its virtues.</p>

<p>In Sweden it is used as a substitute for hops in the brewing
of beer. Among the superstitious, even of the present day,
it is regarded as a most potent love-charm, when plucked
by a love-lorn maiden from the grave of a young man, while
repeating the proper formula.</p>

<p>In the spring, the plants first develop a rosette of finely
dissected, feathery leaves, which lie flat upon the ground.
Later, when these are well grown, it sends up its tall flower-stalks,
crowned with close, flat clusters of small white blossoms.</p>

<p>M. Naudin, who has an intimate knowledge of the plants
of dry countries, recommends the yarrow for lawn-making
where irrigation is impossible. "It grows freely in the driest
of weather, and makes a handsome turf. It must be frequently
cut, however, to prevent it from throwing up flower-stems. It
will not succeed on a lime-impregnated soil."</p>

<p>Among children the yarrow is commonly known as "old
man." <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[ 98]</a></span></p>


<h3>RATTLESNAKE PLANTAIN.</h3>

<h4><i>Goodyera Menziesii</i>, Lindl. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two or three inches long; leathery; dark green, veined
with white. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Six to fifteen inches high, with scattered lanceolate
bracts. <i>Spike.</i>&mdash;Many-flowered. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;White; two to four
lines long; downy. Lateral sepals deflexed; upper and two petals
coherent. Lip erect, saccate below, concave above, and narrowing
into the recurved summit. <i>Anther.</i>&mdash;On the base of the column
behind. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mountains, from Mendocino
and Mariposa Counties to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The rattlesnake plantain is frequently met under the coniferous
trees of our northern woods. Its common name comes
from the mottling of its leaves, which is similar to that of the
rattlesnake's skin. In midsummer, or later, the plant sends
up a stalk of small but shapely little blossoms. These are so
modest, one would hardly suspect they belonged to the showy
orchis family.</p>


<h3>BUTTON-BUSH. BUTTON-WILLOW.</h3>

<h4><i>Cephalanthus occidentalis</i>, L. Madder Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs eight to ten feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite, or in whorls of
three or four; petioled; ovate to lanceolate; three to five inches long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; white; in spherical heads an inch in diameter.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Four-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Long funnel-form with four-cleft
limb. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; short; borne on the throat of the corolla.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- to four-celled. Style long-exserted. Stigma capitate.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The button-bush is a handsome shrub, found upon stream
borders, often standing where its roots are constantly under
water. Its leaves are willow-like, and its spherical flower-heads,
poised gracefully at the ends of the branches, resemble
small cushions filled with pins. The blossoms often have a
jessamine-like fragrance.</p>

<p>A tincture made of the bark is used by physicians as a tonic
and laxative and as a remedy for fevers and coughs.</p>

<p>This shrub is especially abundant in the interior, on the
lower reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento Rivers,
where it is in bloom from June to August.</p>

<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Six lines or so long; white. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. Anthers opening
terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. Style long; curved. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Middle Sierras and Mendocino County, and northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The great coniferous forests of our higher mountains afford
homes for many interesting members of the Heath family. A
trip to the Sierras in August will yield many a prize to the
flower-lover. <i>Pyrolas</i>, with waxen clusters, vie with <i>Pipsissiwas</i>;
the weird looking <i>Pterospora</i> rears its uncanny, gummy
stems, clothed with small, yellowish bells, while an occasional
glimpse of a blood-red spike betrays the most wonderful of
them all&mdash;the snow-plant.</p>

<p>Of the <i>Pyrolas</i> we made the acquaintance of three in this
region. These pretty plants are called "shinleaf," because
the leaves of some of the species were used by the English
peasantry as plasters which they applied to bruises or sores.
<i>Pyrola picta</i>, with its rich leathery, white-veined leaves and
clusters of whitish, waxen flowers, was quite plentiful and
always a delight to meet. <i>Pyrola dentata</i>, Smith, we often
found growing with it. This has spatulate, wavy-margined
leaves; which are pale and not veined with white, and its scapes
are more slender. It never was so attractive or vigorous a
plant as the other.</p>

<p>A ramble in the woods one day brought us to the brink of
a charming stream, whose pure, ice-cold waters babbled along
most invitingly. Following its course, we found ourselves in
a delightfully cool, moist thicket, where, nestling in the deep
shade, we found the beautiful, rich, glossy leaves of <i>Pyrola
rotundifolia, var. bracteata</i>, Gray. The leaves are roundish,
of a beautiful, bright chrome green, highly polished, and the
delicate flowers are rose-pink. This is called "Indian lettuce"
and "canker lettuce," and a tincture of the fresh plant is used
in medicine for the same purposes as chimaphila. <i>P. aphylla</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[ 102]</a></span>
Smith, is easily distinguished by the absence of leaves. It has
flesh-colored stems, and its flowers are sometimes of the same
color, and sometimes white. This is found in the Coast Ranges.</p>

sessile; lanceolate or linear-lanceolate; two to four inches
long; white-woolly, at length becoming green above. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Of filiform
disk-flowers only. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Of many rows of pearly white,
pointed scales, not longer than the flowers, resembling ray-flowers.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed over the northern parts of America and Asia.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our wild everlasting flowers are very difficult of determination,
and are comprised under at least three genera, <i>Gnaphalium</i>,
<i>Anaphalis</i>, and <i>Antennaria</i>. The word <i>Anaphalis</i> is
from the same root as the word <i>Gnaphalium</i>, and the species
have quite the aspect of <i>Gnaphalium</i>.</p>

<p>The flowers of the pearly everlasting have a peculiarly pure
pearly look before they are entirely open, and their sharp-pointed
little scales give them a prim, set look, like very regular,
tiny white roses. There is a hint of green in them, but
they are never of the dirty yellowish-white of the cudweed, nor
have they the slippery-elm-like fragrance of the latter. When
fully expanded, the centers are brown. The leaves, which at
length become a dark, shining green, make a fine contrast with
the permanently white-woolly stems. The flower-clusters are
loosely compound.</p>


<h3>WASHINGTON LILY. SHASTA LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium Washingtonianum</i>, Kell. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the Sierras from three to six thousand feet
elevation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall never forget the thrill of delight I felt on first beholding
this noble white lily, some years ago, in an open fir forest
near Mt. Shasta. I had often heard of it, but never dared
hope it would be my privilege to gather it for myself in its own
native haunts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[ 103]</a></span></p>

<p>The blossoms somewhat resemble those of the ruby lily, but
the petals have longer claws and are more loosely put together.
They are fragrant, but their perfume is not to be compared with
that of the ruby lily.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy once saw, upon a single great mountain-side,
ten thousand of these wonderful plants, upbearing their beautiful,
pure lilies&mdash;a sight outrivaling the poet's vision of the
golden daffodils.</p>

<p>The Shasta lily is never found in the Coast Ranges. Another
species, <i>L. Parryi</i>, Wats., resembling this in the form
of its flowers, is found in the San Bernardino Mountains. This
is known as the "lemon lily," and has clear yellow flowers,
dotted sparingly with deeper yellow. It is a charming flower,
and is always found in shaded, springy places in cool cañons.</p>


<h3>LABRADOR TEA.</h3>

<h4><i>Ledum glandulosum</i>, Nutt. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled;
oblong or oval; an inch or two long; coriaceous; sprinkled beneath
with resin-dots. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White; in terminal and axillary clusters.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; three lines long; rotately spreading.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four to ten. Anthers opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled.
Style filiform, persistent. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from
Mendocino County northward, and through the Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our Labrador tea is a comely shrub, found in the mountains
at an elevation of four thousand feet and upward. Its
small, leathery leaves are miniature copies of those of the Californian
rhododendron, differing from them, however, in the
sprinkling of resin-dots upon the under surface.</p>

<p>Upon seeing the flowers of this shrub for the first time, one
is apt to imagine it a member of the Rose family, something
akin to the cherry, with its clusters of small white flowers of a
bitter fragrance; but a glance at the anthers, with their terminal
pores, tells the story quickly.</p>

<p>A tea made from the leaves is, with many people, a valued
remedy for rheumatism.</p>

<p>This little shrub is much dreaded by sheepmen, who claim
that it poisons their flocks. It has been suggested that it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[ 104]</a></span>
would be an excellent thing to have it widely planted as a
means of reducing these bands of "hoofed locusts," as Mr.
Muir terms them&mdash;these marauders who trample down so
much beauty, and leave desolation everywhere in their wake.</p>


<h3>PIPSISSIWA. PRINCE'S PINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Chimaphila Menziesii</i>, Spreng. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen lines long;
dark green, sometimes variegated with white; leathery. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;One
to three. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted; white. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; waxen-white
or pinkish. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. Filaments enlarged and hairy in
the middle. Anthers two-celled; opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled.
Style short. Stigma button-like. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Middle Sierras
and Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>

<p>The prince's pine is a charming little plant, and may be
found beneath the undergrowth in the great coniferous woods
of the Sierras, where it sits demurely with bowed head, like
some cloistered nun engaged with her own meditations. It
has an exquisite perfume, like that of the lily of the valley.</p>

<p>The common prince's pine of the Eastern States&mdash;<i>C. umbellata</i>&mdash;is
more rare with us, though it is found through
somewhat the same range as the above. It is a more vigorous
plant than the other, has from four to seven purplish flowers
in the cluster, while its leaves are never spotted.</p>

<p>In the East, from the leaves of this species is manufactured
the drug "chimaphila," which is valued as a tonic and astringent,
also as a remedy for cataract.</p>


<h3>GROUNDSEL-TREE.</h3>

<h4><i>Baccharis pilularis</i>, DC. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Evergreen di&#339;cious shrubs, one to twelve feet high, with angled or
striate branches. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; sessile; obovate; cuneate; obtuse;
coarsely toothed; leathery; one inch or less long. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Crowded
at the ends of the branchlets; four lines long; one or two
across; without ray-flowers. <i>Involucres.</i>&mdash;Oblong; of many imbricated
scales. <i>Sterile heads.</i>&mdash;With funnel-form, five-lobed corollas.
<i>Fertile heads.</i>&mdash;With filiform corollas, mixed with a dense white silky
pappus, which soon elongates. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;All along the Coast.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p>In the fall, the dark-green foliage of the groundsel-tree is
relieved by its abundant small white flower-clusters. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[ 106]</a></span>
flowers of the male shrub are never very beautiful, being usually
of a yellowish or dirty white; indeed, so little resembling
the other, as to appear like a separate species. But when the
white silk down of the female shrub is fully expanded, its
boughs are laden as with drifted snow. This lavish provision
of silk is designed by nature for the wafting abroad of the
seed.</p>

<p>It varies greatly in size and habit. Upon exposed, wind-swept
sandhills it is low and close-cropped, but in more favorable
localities, where the soil is rich and the climate more
genial, it responds graciously to the changed conditions, becoming
one of our most picturesque shrubs.</p>

<p>Growing and blooming at the same time with the above,
may be found its near relative&mdash;<i>B. Douglasii</i>, DC. This does
not aspire to shrubhood, but its tall stems, with their lanceolate,
somewhat glutinous leaves, sometimes reach four feet in
height, bearing at summit their pretty Ageratum-like, white
flower-clusters. It loves the sandy soil of creek-banks and
low fields, and is abundant from San Francisco to Los Angeles.</p>


<h3>LARGE WHITE MOUNTAIN DAISY.</h3>

<h4><i>Erigeron Coulteri</i>, T.C. Porter. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Six to twenty inches high; leafy; bearing solitary or rarely
two or three large, slender-peduncled heads. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Obovate to
oblong; entire or with several sharp teeth; thin. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Of
yellow disk-flowers, and usually pure white ray-flowers. <i>Disk.</i>&mdash;Half
an inch wide. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Fifty to seventy; narrowly linear; six lines or

<h3>CALIFORNIAN FALSE HELLEBORE.</h3>

<h4><i>Veratrum Californicum</i>, Durand. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; three to seven feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oval; narrowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[ 108]</a></span>
to lanceolate; sessile; sheathing; four to twelve inches long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Greenish-white in a large panicle, with usually ascending
branches. <i>Stamens and pistils</i> in the same flowers, or in separate
ones. <i>Pedicels.</i>&mdash;About two lines long. <i>Perianth segments.</i>&mdash;Six;
spreading; oblanceolate; their bases thickened and green or brownish;
upper margins sometimes minutely toothed; three to eight lines long.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. Anthers confluently one-celled. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Styles three, divergent. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Middle Sierras and Mendocino
County northward to the Columbia; also eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The false hellebore may be found in midsummer in the
mountains. It grows along watercourses, and often covers
rich, moist meadows, where its stems rise from three to seven
feet, with their coarsely ribbed, boat-shaped leaves and large
panicles of greenish-white flowers. When at its best it is a
rather fine, showy thing, but its leaves are often perforated by
some insect, and present a ragged, untidy appearance.</p>

<p>The mountaineers commonly call this plant "skunk cabbage,"
a deplorable misnomer, because it is in no sense
merited; and, moreover, we have a plant to which the title
more rightfully belongs. The root and young shoots are a
violent poison, and are fatal to animals which are unfortunate
enough to crop them.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>V. fimbriatum</i>, Gray&mdash;a smaller plant, is
found upon the plains in Mendocino County. It may be distinguished
from the above by its more slender leaves, its woolly
flower-panicle, and its decidedly fringed flower-petals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[ 109]</a></span></p>

<h3>SUN-CUPS.</h3>

<h4><i>&#338;nothera ovata</i>, Nutt. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;A thick tap-root. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; oblong-lanceolate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[ 110]</a></span>
smooth; ciliate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary in the axils; bright golden yellow.
<i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Filiform; one to five inches long; limb of four lanceolate,
reflexed divisions. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; three to ten lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-celled; underground. Style filiform. Stigma
capitate. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A ribbed capsule. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the coast from San
Francisco to Monterey.</p></blockquote>

<p>This little evening primrose is an exceedingly interesting
plant, although it is not of very wide distribution. The flat
rosettes of leaves sometimes measure over a foot across, and
are thickly sown with the bright golden flowers, large in proportion
to the size of the plants. A flower or bud is found in
the axil of every leaf, diminishing in size toward the center,
one plant sometimes having a hundred blossoms and buds.
These flowers are peculiarly fresh and winsome, and were they
not so abundant where they grow they would doubtless be
considered very beautiful.</p>

<p>A strange feature of the plant is its flower-stem, which is
not a flower-stem at all, but a very much prolonged calyx-tube,
the seed-vessel being just within the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>We wonder how these imprisoned seeds are going to
escape and find lodgment to start new colonies elsewhere.
Perhaps the moles and gophers could tell something about it
if they would.</p>

<p>The leaves of these little plants are sometimes used for
salads.</p>

<p>These blossoms are often erroneously called "cow-slips."</p>


<h3>COMMON BUTTERCUP.</h3>

<h4><i>Ranunculus Californicus</i>, Benth. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; branching; six to eighteen inches high. <i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Commonly
pinnately ternate; the leaflets cut into three to
seven usually linear lobes. Divisions of the stem-leaves usually narrower.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Five to ten lines in diameter; shining golden yellow.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Green; strongly reflexed. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Ten to fourteen; obovate;
each with a small scale at the base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Pistils.</i></p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice;</span>
<span class="ni">And there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean</span>
<span class="ni">To be some happy creature's palace."</span>
</div></div>


<p>The first clear, beautiful note of a lark has been heard;
skies are blue and fields are green; little frogs are filling the air
with their music;&mdash;and the buttercups are here. The fields
are full of them, and their bright golden eyes starring the
meadows, bring a gladness to the face of nature. The children
wade knee-deep in their gold, filling their hands with treasure;
and yonder, where their golden masses cover the slopes, King
Midas may have passed, transforming the earth with his magical
touch.</p>

<p>Because some of the buttercups grow where frogs abound,
Pliny bestowed the Latin name <i>Ranunculus</i>, meaning "little
frog."</p>

<p>The Indians, who seem to have a use for everything, parch
the seeds of our common buttercup and beat them to a flour,
which they eat without the further formality of cooking. This
flour is said to have the peculiar rich flavor of parched corn.</p>

<p>We have a number of other species of buttercup&mdash;some of
them denizens of marshy spots; but the common field buttercup
is widest-spread and best known.</p>


<h3>CREAM-CUPS.</h3>

<h4><i>Platystemon Californicus</i>, Benth. Poppy Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Delicate hairy herbs. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A span or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
opposite; sessile; two to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Axillary;
long-peduncled; an inch or so across. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Three; falling early.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Six, in two rows; cream-color, often with a yellow spot at
base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. Filaments broad; petaloid. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Six
to twenty-five; united in a ring at first; afterward separating. Stigmas
terminal. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f037.png">CREAM-CUPS&mdash;<i>Platystemon Californicus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The cream-cups are delicate, hairy plants of the early
springtime, which often grow in masses and take possession
of whole fields. They seem to be more vigorous in the south,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[ 114]</a></span>
and produce larger flowers there than in the north, often having
as many as nine petals. The delicate, nodding green buds
(like miniature poppy-buds) soon throw off their outer wrappings,
and, emerging from captivity, gradually assume an erect
position and unfurl their lovely, pure, straw-colored petals to
their widest extent. These blossoms open for several successive
days.</p>

<p>The genus takes its name from the flat filaments. The numerous
slender pistils are so cleverly joined together into a
cylinder, that they appear like a hollow, one-celled ovary. But
a cross-section will show the separate ovaries under a glass.</p>

<p>Some people like the odor of these flowers; but I must confess
to a lack of appreciation of it. I suspect its charm must
exist in some pleasant association.</p>


<h3>COPA DE ORO. CALIFORNIA POPPY. TOROSA.</h3>

<h4><i>Eschscholtzia Californica</i>, Cham. Poppy Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Twelve to eighteen inches high; branching. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
finely dissected; glaucous. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Two or three inches
across; usually orange; but ranging from that to white. Summit of
the peduncle enlarging into a cup-shaped torus or disk, upon the upper
inner surface of which are borne the calyx, corolla, and stamens.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;A pointed green cap, falling early. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous,
in four groups, in front of the petals. Anthers linear.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style short. Stigmas four to six; unequal.

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f038.png">CALIFORNIA POPPY&mdash;<i>Eschscholtzia Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is difficult to exaggerate the charms of this wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[ 116]</a></span>
flower. When reproduced in countless millions, its brilliant
blossoms fairly cover the earth; and far away upon distant
mountain-slopes, bright patches of red gold denote that league
after league of it lies open to the sun. It revels in the sunshine,
and not until the morning is well advanced does it begin
to unfurl its tightly rolled petals.</p>

<p>In the early days, when Spanish vessels sailed up and down
the newly-discovered coast, the mariners, looking inland, saw
the flame of the poppies upon the hills and called this "the land
of fire." They said that the altar-cloth of San Pascual was
spread upon the hills, and, filled with a devotional spirit, they
disembarked to worship upon the shore.</p>

<p>This flower is now cultivated in many parts of the world.
But one can form no conception of it, pale and languishing in
a foreign garden. One must go to its native hillsides to get
any idea of its prodigal beauty.</p>

<p>The common title, "California poppy," though it has been
widely used, is open to the objection that it belongs more
properly to another flower, <i>Papaver Californicum</i>. The generic
name is dissonant and harsh. Why not replace it by one
of the more euphonious Spanish titles&mdash;"amapola," "dormidera,"
"torosa," or, most charmingly appropriate of all,
"copa de oro,"&mdash;"cup of gold"?</p>

<p>There are many forms of <i>Eschscholtzia</i>, and of late the original
species, <i>E. Californica</i>, has been divided into a number of
new species, which are, however, difficult of determination.</p>

<p>The Indians of Placer County, it is said, boil the herbage,
or roast it by means of hot stones, lay it in water afterward,
and then eat it as a green. A drug made from this plant is
used in medicine as a harmless substitute for morphine and as
a remedy for headache and insomnia, and it has an especially
excellent effect with children. The Spanish-Californians make
a hair-oil, which they prize highly, by frying the whole plant
in olive oil and adding some choice perfume. This is said to
promote the growth of the hair and to make it glossy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[ 117]</a></span></p>


<h3>MOCK-ORANGE. GOURD. CHILI-COJOTE.
CALABAZILLA.</h3>

<h4><i>Cucurbita f&#339;tidissima</i>, HBK. Gourd Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Long; coarse; trailing. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; petioled;
triangular-cordate; six to twelve inches long; acute; rough. <i>Tendrils.</i>&mdash;Three- to
five-cleft. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; yellow; three or four

five linear lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five-cleft to the middle or
lower; with recurved lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;In the male flowers two with
two-celled anthers, and one with one; in the female all three rudimentary.

<p>The rough, ill-smelling foliage of the Chili-cojote is a common
sight in Southern California, where it may be seen trailing
over many a field; but woe to the negligent farmer who allows
this pest to get a foothold&mdash;for it will cost him a small fortune
to eradicate it. It sends down into the earth an enormous
root, six feet or so long, and often as broad. When the
gourds are ripe, these vines look like the dumping-ground for
numerous poor, discarded oranges.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding its unsavory character, the various parts
of this vine are put to use&mdash;specially among the Spanish-Californians
and the Indians. The root is a purgative more
powerful than croton-oil. When pounded to a pulp, it is used
as soap by the Spanish-Californians, who aver that it cleanses
as nothing else can; but rinsing must be very thorough&mdash;for
any particles remaining in the garments prove very irritating
to the skin. The leaves are highly valued for medicinal purposes,
and the pulp of the green fruit, mixed with soap, is said
to remove stains from clothing. The Indians eat the seed,
when ground and made into a mush. The early Californian
women used the gourds as darning-balls.</p>

<p>This vine is a near relative of the pumpkins and squashes
of our gardens.</p>

<p>The flowers are said to be violet-scented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[ 118]</a></span></p>

<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Deep coast woods, from Monterey to Vancouver Island.</p></blockquote>

<p>The water-holly is one of the beautiful plants to be found
in our deep coast woods within the cool influence of the sea-fogs.
The plants are very symmetrical, with their crown of
dark, shining leaves, with numerous prickly leaflets, and in
spring, when the long graceful racemes of yellow flowers are
produced in abundance, and hang amid and below the leaves,
they are very ornamental. The stems are densely clothed
with numerous dry, awl-shaped scales, an inch or more long.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>B. repens</i>&mdash;the creeping barberry, or
Oregon grape, is a low, prostrate shrub, less than a foot high,
with from three to seven leaflets. These leaflets are pinnately
veined, and have not the beautiful, shining upper surface of
those of the water-holly, and the few racemes of yellow flowers
which terminate the branches are quite short&mdash;only an inch or
two long. This is found throughout the State and northward
upon rocky hills.</p>


<h3>TREE-POPPY.</h3>

<h4><i>Dendromecon rigidum</i>, Benth. Poppy Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;One to three inches long;
leathery. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; yellow; one to three inches across.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two; falling early. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Many. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Linear;
one-celled. Stigma two-lobed. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Eighteen to thirty
lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry hills from San Diego to Butte County.</p></blockquote>


<p>The tree-poppy is the only truly woody plant in the poppy
family. Its pale leaves are quite rigid, and resemble those of
the willow in form. The bright golden flowers are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[ 120]</a></span>
three inches across, and one can readily imagine the fine effect
produced when many of them are open at once upon a hillside.
Though found through quite a range, this shrub attains its
most perfect development in Santa Barbara County.</p>

<p>On wind-swept downs near the ocean, on the low hills of the
Coast Ranges, or upon the plains of the interior, this charming
golden pansy spreads itself in profusion in early spring. It
is the darling of the children, who on their way to school
gather great handfuls of its brown-eyed blossoms.</p>

<p>You may often see myriads of them dancing on their long
stems in the breeze, and showing glimpses of red-brown where
their purplish outer petals are turned toward you for the moment.
In the shelter of quiet woodlands, its stems are longer
and more fragile.</p>

to Lake Superior.</p></blockquote>

<p>A walk through some moist thicket, or along a stream-bank
in March, will reveal the yellow flowers of the twin-berry amid
its ample, thin green leaves. These blossoms are always borne
in pairs at the summit of the stem, and are surrounded by a
leafy involucre, consisting of two pairs of round, fluted bracts.
As the berries ripen and become black, these bracts deepen to
a brilliant red and make the shrubs much more conspicuous
and ornamental than at blossoming-time.</p>


<h3>OREGON GRAPE. HOLLY-LEAVED BARBERRY.

<i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Seven to nine; glossy; ovate to oblong-lanceolate;
one and one half to four inches long; acuminate; sinuately dentate,
with numerous spinose teeth; the lowest pair distant from the stem.
<i>Racemes.</i>&mdash;Eighteen lines to two inches long; clustered near the ends
of the branches. (Otherwise as <i>B. nervosa</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges
and Sierras from Monterey and Kern County northward into Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The holly-leaved barberry, or Oregon grape, is a very ornamental
shrub and one much prized in our gardens, where it is
known as <i>Mahonia Aquifolium</i>. In the spring, when yellow
with its masses of flowers; or in its summer dress of rich, shining
green; or in the autumn, when its foliage is richly touched
with bronze or scarlet or yellow, amid which are the beautiful
blue berries, it is always a fine shrub. In its native haunts it
affects greater altitudes than our other species.</p>

</div>

<p>Among our Californian Indians, a decoction made from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[ 124]</a></span>
root is a favorite tonic remedy, and it has become a recognized
drug in the pharmacop&#339;ia of our Coast, being used as an
alterative and tonic. The root is tough and hard, of a bright
golden yellow, and intensely bitter. The bark of the root is
the part that is used medicinally.</p>

<p>The shrub is very plentiful in the woods of Mendocino
County, where it covers considerable areas.</p>


<h3>SUNSHINE. FLY-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Bæria gracilis</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Six inches or so high; branching freely. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly opposite;
linear; entire; an inch or so long. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Yellow; of disk
and ray-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Ten to fourteen; three or four lines long.
<i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; of a single series of small lanceolate, herbaceous
scales. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Francisco southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Considered singly, the blossom of this plant is a simple,
unassuming little flower; but when countless millions of its
golden stars stud the nether firmament, it becomes one of the
most conspicuous of all our <i>Compositæ</i>. It literally covers the
earth with a close carpet of rich golden bloom, and other
plants, such as scarlet paint-brushes, blue Phacelias, and yellow
and white tidy-tips, rise out of its golden tapestry. Mile after
mile of it whirls by the car-window as we journey along, or
long stretches of it gild the gently rounded hill-slopes of the
distant landscape.</p>

<p>There are several other species of <i>Bæria</i>, but this is the
most abundant and widespread. In some localities this little
plant is so much frequented by a small fly, which feeds upon
its pollen, that it is called "fly-flower." It then becomes a
serious nuisance to horses and cattle, which grow wild and
restive under the persecution of this insect.</p>

<p>In the Spanish deck of playing-cards in the early days, the
"Jack of Spades" always held one of these flowers in his
hand. By the Spanish-Californians it was called "Si me
quieres, no me quieres"&mdash;"Love me, love me not,"&mdash;because
their dark-eyed maidens tried their fortunes upon it in the
same manner that our own maidens consult the marguerite.</p>

their gold with that of the <i>Bæria</i>, the charming feathery blossoms
of <i>Pentachæta aurea</i>, Nutt., are found in midspring.
They have from fifty to seventy rays and their involucres consist
of several rows of scarious-margined bracts.</p>


<h3>MEADOW-FOAM.</h3>

<h4><i>Fl&#339;rkia Douglasii</i>, Baillon. Geranium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Smooth, succulent herbs. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or so long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Much
dissected. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Axillary; solitary. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Narrow;
acute. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Nine lines long or so; yellow, sometimes tipped with
white, white, or rose-tinged. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten, in two sets; a gland at
the base of those opposite the sepals. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of five carpels, becoming
distinct. Style five-cleft at the apex. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Limnanthes Douglasii</i>,
R. Br. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Oregon to Southern California.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the spring is well advanced, our wet meadows are all
a-cream with the meadow-foam, whose dense masses blend
exquisitely with the rich red of the common sorrel, which is
in blossom at the same time.</p>

<p>This plant is a near relative of the redwood-sorrel, and its
flowers are similar in size and veining, and also in their habit
of closing at night. It is much admired and has long been in
cultivation.</p>


<h3>PIMPERNEL. POOR-MAN'S WEATHER-GLASS.</h3>

<h4><i>Anagallis arvensis</i>, L. Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Prostrate; spreading. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually opposite; sessile;
ovate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary on axillary peduncles; orange-vermilion
(rarely blue or white); six lines or so across. <i>Calyx</i> and rotate corolla
five-parted. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Rounded; purple at base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
opposite the petals. Filaments purple, bearded. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Globose;
the top falling off as a lid. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common everywhere. Introduced
from Europe.</p></blockquote>

<p>The little orange-vermilion flower of the pimpernel is a
plain little blossom to the unassisted eye, but it becomes truly
regal when seen under a glass, where its rich purple center displays
itself in glistening splendor. It is a forcible example of
the infinite care bestowed upon all of Nature's children, even
to the humblest weeds.</p>

<div class="image" id="f043"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f043.png">MEADOW-FOAM&mdash;<i>Fl&#339;rkia Douglasii</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This little plant has come to us from Europe, and it makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[ 128]</a></span>
itself perfectly at home among us in many widely-differing
situations. From the fact that it furls its petals upon cloudy
days, or at the approach of rain, it is called in England "poor-man's
weather-glass."</p>

<p>The plant is an acrid poison and was extensively used in
medicine by the ancients. It seems to act particularly upon
the nervous system, and was used as a remedy for convulsions,
the plague, gout, and hydrophobia.</p>

<h4><i>Encelia Californica</i>, Nutt. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Bushy; two to four feet high; strong-scented. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
alternate; short-petioled; ovate-lanceolate; an inch or two long.
<i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary; long-peduncled; large. <i>Disk.</i>&mdash;Eight lines
across; of black-purple, tubular flowers, with deep-yellow styles.
<i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Sterile; over an inch long; five lines wide; four-toothed. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Open-campanulate
of several series of coriaceous, imbricated
scales. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This shrubby <i>Composita</i> is quite abundant in the south, and
when covered with its large yellow flowers with purple-brown
centers is very showy. We have seen mesas covered with the
bushes, which have much the same spreading habit as the
white marguerite of the garden. It thrives particularly well
near the coast, but is also at home upon some of the hills of
interior valleys as well. It is quite strong-scented, but the
flowers are very handsome, rivaling in decorativeness many of
the cherished plants of our gardens.</p>


<h3>YELLOW FORGET-ME-NOT. WOOLLY-BREECHES.</h3>

<h4><i>Amsinckia</i>, Lehm. Borage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Hispid annuals. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; oblong-ovate to linear.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; yellow or orange, in coiled spikes or racemes.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted; persistent. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Salver-shaped, or somewhat
funnel-form; with five-lobed border; the throat naked or with
minute hairy tufts opposite the lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of
four seedlike nutlets. Style filiform. Stigma capitate.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have several species of <i>Amsinckia</i>, all of which have
small yellow flowers, resembling in form our little white forget-me-nots.
The genus is a Western American one, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[ 129]</a></span>
species are very difficult of determination. They are all hispid
plants, very disagreeable to handle, and are generally of rank
growth. They often occur in great masses, when they become
rather showy.</p>

<p>The largest-flowered species, which is also the most common
one in the south, is <i>A. spectabilis</i>, Fisch. and Mey. The
corolla of this is often half an inch long and half an inch across,
of an orange-yellow, with deeper orange spots in the throat.</p>


<h3>TREE-TOBACCO.</h3>

<h4><i>Nicotiana glauca</i>, Graham. Nightshade Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Loosely branching shrubs, fifteen feet or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; ovate; smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Clustered at the ends of
the branches. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular;
eighteen lines long; with constricted throat; and border shortly
five-toothed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five, on the base of the corolla, adnate to
the tube below. Anthers with two diverging cells. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style slender. Stigma capitate; two-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
Southern California; introduced.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tall, loosely branching, spreading form of the tree-tobacco
is a familiar sight in the south about vacant lots and
waste places. Its clusters of long, greenish-yellow flowers
hang gracefully from the ends of the slender branches, and the
ovate leaves are rather long-stalked. It is supposed to have
been introduced from Buenos Ayres, and old inhabitants remember
the time when but one or two plants were known.
In thirty years it has spread rapidly, and is now exceedingly
common.</p>


<h3>WIND-POPPY. BLOOD-DROP. FLAMING POPPY.</h3>

<h4><i>Meconopsis heterophylla</i>, Benth. Poppy Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Smooth herbs. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; a foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
petioled; pinnately divided into variously toothed, oval to linear
segments. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; on long peduncles; orange-vermilion
to scarlet. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two; falling early. Petals.&mdash;Four; two to twelve
lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. Filaments filiform; purple. Anthers
yellow. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Top-shaped; ribbed; one-celled. Style short. Stigma
large; capitate; four- to eight-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout Western
California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wind-poppy is an exceedingly variable flower. In the
central part of the State it is large and showy, its beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[ 130]</a></span>
flame-colored blossoms being two inches across; while in the
south it is usually very small, making tiny flecks of red in the
grass, for which reason it is there called "blood-drop." It is
an exquisite thing. Its petals have the delicate satin texture
of the poppy; and their showy orange or scarlet blends suddenly
at the center into a deep maroon. The bright-green,
top-shaped ovary stands up in the midst of the slender stamens,
whose yellow anthers show brilliantly against the dark
maroon of the petals.</p>

<p>It blossoms in spring upon open hillsides, seeming to prefer
those which are shaded for at least part of the day. It is very
fragile, and falls to pieces at a touch, which makes it an unsatisfactory
flower to gather.</p>


<h3>WHISPERING BELLS.</h3>

<h4><i>Emmenanthe penduliflora</i>, Benth. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Six inches to a foot high; branched above; hairy; somewhat viscid.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;An inch or more long; pinnatifid. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Straw-colored;
at length pendulous. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; about six lines long.
(Flower structure as in <i>Phacelia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Lake County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>In midspring, when passing among the plants upon our
dry, open hillsides, our attention is often attracted by a certain
delicate, rustling sound, which we find emanates from the little
papery bells of the dried blossoms of the <i>Emmenanthe</i>, which
retain the semblance of their first freshness for many weeks.</p>

<p>Though not at first apparent, a little examination will reveal
the fact that these plants are very closely related to the <i>Phacelias</i>,
the chief difference being in the yellow corollas.</p>


<h3>YELLOW STAR TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus Benthami</i>, Baker. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Much elongated; two to five lines broad. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender;
three to six inches high. <i>Buds.</i>&mdash;Nodding. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Erect;
yellow. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Six or seven lines long; spreading; mostly obtuse;
rather densely covered with yellow hairs. <i>Gland.</i>&mdash;Shallow; lunate.
<i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Nodding; six to nine lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Sierra Nevada
foothills, throughout their length.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a very pretty little star tulip, with graceful, flexuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[ 132]</a></span>
stems and erect flowers, whose spreading petals are covered
with hairs. Sometimes there is a dark-brown, almost black,
spot upon the petals, and when such is the case the plant is
called <i>C. Benthami, var. Wallacei</i>.</p>


<h3>CREAM-COLORED WALL-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Erysimum grandiflorum</i>, Nutt. Mustard Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Spatulate or oblanceolate;
entire, toothed or lobed; lower long-petioled. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Four;
one pair strongly gibbous at base. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;An inch long; long-clawed;
cream-color or yellowish. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; two shorter.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled; linear. Style stout; short. Stigma capitate.
<i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Nearly flat; thirty lines or less long. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Cheiranthus asper</i>,
Cham. and Schlecht. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The seaboard from Los Angeles to
Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Growing along sandy stretches, or upon open mesas by the
seashore, we may find the showy blossoms of the cream-colored
wall-flower from February to May. These flowers
are less stocky and much more delicate than the garden
species; and when seen numerously dotting a field carpeted
with other flowers, they stand out conspicuously, claiming the
attention peculiarly to themselves. They have not the delicious
fragrance of the Western wall-flower. At first yellowish,
they become pale cream-color after fertilization has taken place.</p>

<p><i>E. asperum</i>, DC., the Western wall-flower, is widely distributed,
and may be known from the above by its four-sided
pods, and by its flowers, which are usually orange-color&mdash;though
they occasionally vary to yellow or purple. These
blossoms are especially abundant in the mountains and valleys
of the south, where their brilliant orange is conspicuous amid
the lush greens of springtime. They are very fragrant, and
are favorites among our wild flowers.</p>

<p>The bur-clover is a little European weed which has become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[ 134]</a></span>
very widespread and very much at home among us. It is
an excellent forage-plant, and in late summer, when our cattle
have eaten everything else, they feed upon the little burs,
which are very nutritious in themselves. But these same little
coiled burs, with their numerous firm hooks, work great
damage to wool, imbedding themselves in it so firmly as to
make it very difficult to remove them without seriously injuring
its quality. These plants invade our lawns, where they
become very troublesome.</p>


<h3>COMMON MONKEY-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Mimulus luteus</i>, L. Figwort Family.</h4>

<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in pairs. Anthers with two divergent cells.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style long and slender. Stigma with two
rounded lips. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bright canary-colored blossoms of the common monkey-flower
are a familiar sight upon almost every stream-bank.
The plant varies greatly in size, according to the locality of
its growth. I once saw it flourishing in the rich soil of a lake-shore,
where its hollow stems were as large as an ordinary
cane, and its blossoms grotesquely large.</p>

<p><i>M. moschatus</i>, Dougl., the common musk-plant of cultivation,
is usually found along mountain-streams. It may be
known by its clammy, musk-scented, light-green herbage.
Its flowers are larger than in cultivation.</p>

<p><i>M. brevipes</i>, Benth., is common from Santa Barbara to San
Diego, upon hillsides in spring. It has stems a foot or two
high, lanceolate leaves one to four inches long, and large,
handsome yellow flowers, having a pair of ridges running down
their open throats.</p>

four to seven lines long; with usually a brown spot at the
base. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Large and spherical. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Four to nine lines
long; a line or so wide; attenuate upward; contorted. (See <i>&#338;nothera</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Ventura to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a very common species of evening primrose in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[ 136]</a></span>
south, and may be found blooming until June. It is very
variable in its manner of growth. In moist, shaded localities
it becomes an erect plant a foot or two high; while upon open,
exposed plains it is often only two or three inches high, but
seems almost to emulate the "sunshine" in its attempt to gild
the plain with its bright blossoms. It frequently grows in
gravelly washes. Its flowers have a peculiarly clean, brilliant,
alert look, and may usually be known by the brown spot at
the base of the petals. The specific name is in reference to
its twice-twisted capsule.</p>

<p>The "beach primrose," <i>&#338;. cheiranthifolia, var. suffruticosa</i>,
Wats., often grows in great beds upon the dry sands of
the seashore, from Monterey to San Diego. Its decumbent
stems are thickly clothed with small, ovate, stemless leaves,
and its silvery foliage makes a beautiful setting for its large
golden flowers.</p>


<h3>FAWN-LILY. DOG'S-TOOTH VIOLET. CHAMISE-LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Erythronium giganteum</i>, Lindl. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Corm.</i>&mdash;Usually elongated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong; six to ten inches
long; dark green, usually mottled in mahogany and dark brown.
<i>Scape.</i>&mdash;One- to many-flowered. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Broadly funnel-form,
with six deciduous segments; at length revolute to the stem. <i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Straw-color,
with orange base, with often a transverse, brownish
band across the base; broadly lanceolate; eighteen lines or so long.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. Filaments filiform. Anthers basifixed. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style slender. Stigma three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The interior
of the Coast Ranges, from Sonoma County to the Willamette Valley.</p></blockquote>

<p>The dog's-tooth violets expand into larger, finer creations
upon our shores than were ever dreamed of elsewhere. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[ 138]</a></span>
seem to imbibe new vigor in the sweet life-giving air of our
Coast Range forests. In Southern Oregon, they reach their
maximum development, manifesting themselves in numerous
beautiful species. With us the common title becomes still more
inappropriate than for the Atlantic species&mdash;for nothing could
be farther from a violet than these large pale flowers, which
in reality look far more like lilies. Indeed, in Mendocino
County they are commonly known as "chamise-lilies." Another
name is "Adam and Eve," bestowed because the plant
often bears a large and a small flower at the same time.</p>

<p>Personally, I am inclined to favor Mr. Burroughs' suggestion
of "fawn-lily." It is both appropriate and pretty. The
two erect leaves are like the ears of a fawn; their beautiful
mottling is not without a hint of the fawn's spots; and the
blossom is lily-like. The plant is shy, too, keeping to the
seclusion of our deep cañons. In such situations we may find
them in groups of a few, or occasionally in beds of hundreds.
No more delightful surprise could be imagined than to come
suddenly upon such a garden far from the habitations of man.
The pale flowers, with orange centers, when fully open, roll
their petals back to the stem, like those of the leopard-lily;
but in cloudy weather they often maintain a campanulate outline.
Plants have frequently been seen with from eight to sixteen
flowers upon a stem, the flowers three or four inches across!</p>

<p>These are great favorites in gardens, and in cultivation are
known as <i>E. grandiflorum</i>. We have several species of <i>Erythronium</i>,
all of them beautiful.</p>


<h3>STICKY MONKEY-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Mimulus glutinosus</i>, Wend. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Glutinous shrubs two to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Narrowly oblong
to linear; one to four inches long; with margins at length rolled backward.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Corn-color to red; eighteen lines to three inches
long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Irregularly five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Funnel-form; five-lobed;
the lobes gnawed. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;White. (See <i>Mimulus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Francisco
to San Diego, and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f048.png">STICKY MONKEY-FLOWER&mdash;<i>Mimulus glutinosus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>During a walk upon the hills, at almost any time of year,
we may find the corn-colored blossoms of the sticky monkey-flower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[ 140]</a></span>
but they are most abundant in spring and summer.
When in full flower the small bushes are very ornamental, as
they are a perfect mass of bloom. They are said to be especially
handsome as greenhouse plants.</p>

<p>The flowers vary through a wide range of color, from
almost white to a rich scarlet, but the commoner hue is the
corn-color. The scarlet-flowered form, found at San Diego,
constitutes the <i>var. puniceus</i>, Gray. Another form, with red-brown
to salmon-colored flowers on very short pedicels, is the
<i>var. linearis</i>, Gray. The very long-flowered form is the <i>var.
brachypus</i>, Gray. The sensitive lips of the stigma close upon
being touched or after receiving pollen.</p>


<h3>CREEPING WOOD-VIOLET.</h3>

<h4><i>Viola sarmentosa</i>, Dougl. Violet Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Creeping. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Round-cordate; six to eighteen lines
broad; finely crenate; often rusty beneath; usually punctate with dark
dots. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Slender. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; light yellow without
and within. (Flower structure as in <i>V. pedunculata</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast
Ranges, from Monterey to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>This modest little violet is found commonly in woods,&mdash;often
in redwood forests,&mdash;where it carpets the ground with its
shapely little round leaves.</p>

<p>Its specific name refers to its running habit.</p>


<h3>COMMON BLACK MUSTARD.</h3>

<h4><i>Brassica nigra</i>, Koch. Mustard Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to twelve feet high. <i>Lower leaves.</i>&mdash;Lyrate;
with large terminal lobes. <i>Upper leaves.</i>&mdash;Lobed or entire. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Four. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; three to four lines long.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style long. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Six to nine
lines long, with seeds in one row. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common everywhere; introduced.</p></blockquote>

<p>I can give no truer idea of the manner of growth of this
common plant in California than by quoting Mrs. Jackson's
charming description of it from "Ramona":&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wild mustard in Southern California is like that
spoken of in the New Testament, in the branches of which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[ 141]</a></span>
birds of the air may rest. Coming up out of the earth, so
slender a stem that dozens can find starting-point in an inch, it
darts up a slender, straight shoot, five, ten, twenty feet, with
hundreds of fine, feathery branches locking and interlocking
with all the other hundreds around it, till it is an inextricable
network, like lace. Then it bursts into yellow bloom, still
finer, more feathery and lacelike. The stems are so infinitesimally
small and of so dark a green, that at a short distance
they do not show, and the cloud of blossoms seems floating in
the air; at times it looks like a golden dust. With a clear,
blue sky behind it, as it is often seen, it looks like a golden
snowstorm."</p>

<p>The tall stems are favorite haunts of the red-winged <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'black-bird'">blackbird</ins>,
who tilts about among them, showing his scarlet wings
and occasionally plunging into the depths below, as though he
found a spot there much to his mind.</p>

<p>A very superior oil is made from the seed of the mustard,
which is one of the strongest antiseptics known. It is especially
adapted to the needs of the druggist, because it does not
become rancid. The flour of mustard is now much used by
surgeons to render their hands aseptic. Tons of the seed are
exported from California every year.</p>


<h3>ECHEVERIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Cotyledon lanceolata</i>, Benth. and Hook. Stonecrop or Orpine Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Fleshy plants, with tufted radical leaves. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Narrowly lanceolate;
the outer ones two to four inches long; acuminate. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Fifteen
inches high; their lower leaves lanceolate; becoming above
broadly triangular-ovate, clasping, acute; bearing on their summit a
branching flower-cluster. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Cylindrical;
of five almost distinct, oblong, acute petals, four to six lines long,
reddish-yellow. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Five; distinct; one-celled.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Los Angeles to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>These plants, which are of frequent occurrence in the south,
usually affect dry, sandy soils. The fleshy foliage is of a warm
tone, owing to a suffusion of pink in the leaves. These have
a loose, erect habit, and are not crowded in dense rosettes, as
are those of some species, and they are so weak that they pull<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[ 142]</a></span>
apart easily. The tall flowering stems have but few leaves,
and are sometimes nearly naked.</p>

<p>In early summer these plants put forth a strong effort,
quickly sending up several tall, vigorous flower-shoots, drawing
upon the nourishment stored in the fleshy leaves, which then
become limp and shriveled.</p>

<p>Growing upon the coast at San Diego is a very curious and
interesting species&mdash;<i>C. edulis</i>, Brew. This has cylindrical
leaves, about the size of a lead-pencil, which grow in tufts,
often a foot or two across. Its flowers are greenish-yellow. It
is commonly known as "finger-tips." Its young leaves are
considered very palatable by the Indians, who use them as a
salad.</p>


<h3>HEN-AND-CHICKENS.</h3>

<h4><i>Cotyledon Californicum</i>, Trelease. Stonecrop or Orpine Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>(For flower structure, see <i>Cotyledon lanceolata</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Central
California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The word "cotyledon" signifies any cup-shaped hollow or
cavity, and has been applied to the plants of this genus on
account of the manner of growth of the leaves, which is usually
in a hollow rosette. The fleshy leaves are often covered with a
bloom or a floury powder. These plants are familiar to most
of us, as some of the species are extensively cultivated in our
gardens as border-plants. Owing to their habit of producing
a circle of young plants around the parent, they are commonly
called "hen-and-chickens." We have several native
species, which are usually found upon warm, rocky hill-slopes,
or upon rocks near the sea.</p>

<p><i>C. Californicum</i> is a beautiful form, with pointed, ovate
leaves, of a light glaucous green, often tinged with pink. Its
flowers are yellow, and have their petals distinct almost to the
base, and its carpels are distinct. We are told that the Indians
make soothing poultices of these leaves.</p>

<div class="image" id="f049"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f049.png">HEN-AND-CHICKENS&mdash;<i>Cotyledon Californicum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>C. pulverulenta</i>, Benth. and Hook.,&mdash;found
from Santa Barbara to San Diego, is a very beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[ 144]</a></span>
plant. It bears its leaves in a symmetrical rosette, like a
diminutive century-plant. These leaves are usually covered with
a dense white bloom, and the outer ones are spatulate, abruptly
pointed, and two to four inches broad at the tip, while the
inner are pointed. The plants are sometimes a foot and a half
across, and send up as many as eight of the leafy flowering
stems, which look like many-storied, slender Chinese pagodas.
The blossoms are pale-red.</p>


<h3>BLADDERPOD.</h3>

<h4><i>Isomeris arborea</i>, Nutt. Caper Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby; evil-scented. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; compound, with three
leaflets. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;With their parts in fours. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Yellow; five
to eight lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight; of equal length. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style short. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Pendulous; inflated; pear-shaped; on a
long stalk. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This low shrub is somewhat plentiful upon the mesas of the
south. Its yellow flowers attract one to it, only to be repulsed
by the dreadful odor of its foliage. It certainly ought to have
some compensating utility for so repellent a characteristic.
The ovary is so long-stalked, even in the flower, that it looks
like an abnormal, inflated stigma.</p>

<p>This is the only species of the genus.</p>


<h3>YELLOW GLOBE-TULIP. DIOGENES' LANTERN.
GOLDEN LILY-BELL.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus pulchellus</i>, Dougl. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Somewhat flexuous, with spreading branches; two inches
to a foot or more high. <i>Radical leaf.</i>&mdash;Equaling or exceeding the
stem; four to twelve lines broad. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Greenish or yellow; eight
to twelve lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Yellow; strongly arched; glandular ciliate.
<i>Gland.</i>&mdash;A deep pit, conspicuously prominent on the outside
of the petals, covered within by appressed hairs. (See <i>Calochortus</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast Ranges, from Monterey to Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f050"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f050.png">DIOGENES' LANTERN&mdash;<i>Calochortus pulchellus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>We have no more charmingly graceful flower than the yellow
globe-tulip. A single, long, grasslike leaf precedes the
flexuous stem, with its quaintly arched and delicately fringed
blossoms. There is a certain quizzical look about these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[ 146]</a></span>
flowers&mdash;something akin to the inquiring look of Diogenes, as
he thrust his lantern into all sorts of out-of-the-way places in
broad daylight. The margins of the petals look as though
they had been snipped into a very fine, delicate fringe, unlike
the slender, tapering hairs of <i>C. alba</i>.</p>

<p>The Indians are fond of the bulbs, which they eat with great
relish, calling them "Bo."</p>


<h3>YELLOW SAND-VERBENA.</h3>

<h4><i>Abronia latifolia</i>, Esch. Four-o'clock Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Prostrate; rubbery. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; unequal; roundish;
an inch or so across; petioled; leathery; gummy. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow;
five or six lines long; in dense clusters, subtended by an involucre
of five distinct bracts. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Salver-shaped. Tube green;
its base strongly angled or winged. Limb yellow; four or five-lobed.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Mostly five, within the perianth. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style
filiform. Stigma club-shaped. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The seashore from Vancouver
Island to Monterey.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fragrant blossoms of the yellow sand-verbena may be
found upon the beach at almost any time of year. The stout
root, which often becomes several feet long, is sometimes eaten
by the Indians.</p>


<h3>SEA-DAHLIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Leptosyne maritima</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; sometimes six inches long; two or three times
divided into rather sparse, linear divisions; quite succulent. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
on naked peduncles from six inches to two feet long;
large; three or four inches across; yellow; of disk- and ray-flowers.
<i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Narrowly oblong; ten-nerved; three-toothed. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Double;
the outer part of several loose, leafy scales; the inner of eight
to twelve, erect, more chaffy ones. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The seashore of San Diego
and the islands.</p></blockquote>

<p>On the cliffs overlooking the sea, where its merry yellow
faces can watch the white-crested breakers as they chase one
another ashore in never-ending succession, and where the pelicans
sail lazily over in lines, and gulls circle and scream, the
sea-dahlia flaunts its large yellow flowers. They closely resemble
the yellow single dahlias of our gardens; but the foliage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[ 148]</a></span>
is cut into long lobes, and has the appearance of a coarse, very
open lace. The odor of the flowers is not especially agreeable,
but the plant merits a place in the garden for its beauty.</p>

<div class="image" id="f051"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f051.png">YELLOW SAND-VERBENA&mdash;<i>Abronia latifolia</i>.</a></p>
</div>


<h3>FALSE LUPINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Thermopsis Californica</i>, Wats. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two feet tall. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;With leafy stipules an inch long.
<i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Three; obovate to oblanceolate; an inch or two long;
somewhat woolly. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow; in long-peduncled recemes.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply five-cleft; the two upper teeth often united. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Papilionaceous;
eight lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten; all distinct.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Silky; six- to eight-seeded. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Marin
County and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The false lupine very closely resembles the true lupines, but
may be distinguished from them by the stamens, which are all
distinct, instead of being united into a sheath. Its silvery
foliage and racemes of rather large canary-colored flowers are
common upon open hill-slopes by April.</p>


<h3>TIDY-TIPS. YELLOW DAISY.</h3>

<h4><i>Layia platyglossa</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or so high; loosely branching. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
sessile; the lower linear and pinnatifid, the upper entire. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
terminal; of disk- and ray-flowers. <i>Disk-flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow,
with black stamens. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Bright yellow, tipped with white;
six lines long; four lines wide; three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
Western California; in low ground.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the most charming of our flowers are the beautiful
tidy-tips. In midspring, countless millions of them lift themselves
above the sheets of golden <i>Bæria</i> on our flower-tapestried
plains. The fresh winds come sweetly laden with
their delicate fragrance. Were they not scattered everywhere
in such lavish profusion, we would doubtless cherish them in
our gardens.</p>

<div class="image" id="f052"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[ 149]</a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f052.png">FALSE TIDY-TIPS&mdash;<i>Leptosyne Douglasii</i>.</a></p>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f052.png">TIDY-TIPS&mdash;<i>Layia Platyglossa</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Growing among these blossoms is often found another
flower, somewhat similar to them. This is <i>Leptosyne Douglasii</i>,
DC., the false tidy-tip. It has not the clean, natty
appearance of <i>Layia platyglossa</i>; for the gradual blending of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[ 150]</a></span>
the light tips into the darker yellow below gives it an indefinite,
unattractive look. There is a difference in the involucre,
which has two series of bracts, and there are no touches of
black among the disk-flowers.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN BUTTERFLY-TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus clavatus</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Los Angeles County to San Luis Obispo and El Dorado County.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all our Mariposa tulips, this is the largest-flowered and
stoutest-stemmed, and once seen is not readily forgotten. Its
magnificent flowers are sometimes six inches across, though
not usually so large, and have the form of a broad-based cup.
The sturdy, zigzagging stems and glaucous leaves and bracts,
combined with the large rich, canary-colored or golden flowers,
make a striking plant. The first glance within the cup shows
the ring of club-shaped hairs, characteristic of this species, and
the anthers radiating starlike in the center; and as the latter
are often a dark, rich prune-purple, the effect can readily be
imagined.</p>

<p>I saw this charming Mariposa blooming in abundance in
May near Newhall, where its golden cups were conspicuously
beautiful against the soft browns of the drying fields and hill-slopes.
It is usually found growing upon lava soil.</p>

<p><i>C. Weedii</i>, Wood., found from San Diego to San Luis
Obispo, is a charming species, somewhat similar to the above.
Its flowers are yellow, purple, or pure white, and it may be
known by several characteristics. Its bulb is heavily coated
with coarse fibers; it has a single, long radical leaf, like <i>C.
albus</i>, but unusual among the Mariposas; and its cups are
covered all over within with silky hairs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[ 151]</a></span></p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4><i>Malacothrix Californica</i>, DC. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; pinnately parted into very narrow linear divisions.
<i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Six inches to a foot high; bearing a solitary, large,
light-yellow head. <i>Flower-head.</i>&mdash;Composed of strap-shaped ray-flowers
only; five-toothed at the apex. <i>Involucres.</i>&mdash;Of narrow acute
scales in two or three series. <i>Receptacle.</i>&mdash;Nearly naked. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San
Francisco to San Diego, and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>These beautiful <i>Compositæ</i> are conspicuous upon our open
plains in late spring, and are among the handsomest plants of
the family. The fine flowers seem to be sown like disks of
light over the flower-carpet of the plain.</p>


<h3>BUTTER-AND-EGGS.</h3>

<h4><i>Orthocarpus erianthus</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Slender, with many erect branches; stems and bracts usually dark-reddish;
soft pubescent. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Deep sulphur-yellow; the slender
falcate upper lip dark purple; the tube very slender, but the sacs of
the lower lip large and deep, their folds hairy within. (See <i>Orthocarpus</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Monterey County and northward; very common.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are many species of <i>Orthocarpus</i>, and they are more
numerous in Middle and Northern California and in the Sierras,
few of them reaching the south. They are very difficult of
determination, and are not well understood by botanists yet.
A common name for the plants of this genus is "owl's clover."</p>


<h3>BRASS BUTTONS.</h3>

<h4><i>Cotula coronopifolia</i>, L. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to a foot long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; lanceolate
or oblong-linear; pinnatifid or entire. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary; yellow;
three to six lines across; without rays. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Of two ranks of
nearly equal, scarious-margined scales. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common everywhere.</p></blockquote>

<p>These little weeds are natives of the Southern Hemisphere,
but are now common everywhere. They affect wet places,
and their little flowers, like brass buttons, are very familiar
objects along our roadsides. The foliage when crushed gives
out a curious odor, between lemon-verbena and camphor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[ 152]</a></span></p>


<h3>DEER-WEED. WILD BROOM.</h3>

<h4><i>Hosackia glabra</i>, Torr. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Woody at base; two to eight feet high; erect or decumbent. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Many;
slender; branching; reed-like. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Sparse; short-petioled;
mostly trifoliolate. Leaflets three to six lines long; oblong to
linear-oblong; nearly glabrous. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In numerous small axillary
umbels; yellow; four lines long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Less than three lines long;
five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Papilionaceous. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine united and
one free. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Elongated; exserted. Seeds two. (See <i>Leguminosæ</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>This graceful, willowy plant, whose slender branches are
closely set with small golden-yellow flowers, in which there is
often a hint of red, is as ornamental as any of the small-flowered
foreign <i>Genestas</i>, or brooms, we grow in our gardens; but because
it is so very abundant throughout our borders, we have
become blind to its merits. It is especially beautiful and symmetrical
in the south, where the low, bushy plants often spread
over several feet of ground; and on the mesas of Coronado,
the plants growing not far removed from one another, lend to
the natural scene the aspect of a garden. There it is in full
flower in April; but in the north the blossoms are usually later
in arriving, and it is often June before they show themselves;
then making whole hill-slopes dull-yellow among the chaparral.</p>

<p>It is a great favorite with the bees, and for them holds untold
treasure in honey-making sweets. Among the mountaineers
it is known as "deer-weed" and "buck-brush," as
both deer and stock are said to feed upon it and flourish, when
pasturage is scarce, though they rarely touch it when other
food is plenty.</p>


<h3>TREFOIL SUMACH. FRAGRANT SUMACH.
SQUAW-BERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Rhus Canadensis, var. trilobata</i>, Gray. Poison-Oak or Cashew Family.</h4>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f053.png">DEER-WEED.&mdash;<i>Hosackia glabra</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[ 154]</a></span></p>
<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to five feet high; spreading. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Three-foliolate.
<i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Sessile; wedge-shaped; six lines to an inch long; pubescent,
becoming smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellowish; minute; borne in short, scaly-bracted
spikes preceding the leaves. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Viscid; reddish; two or
three lines in diameter; pleasantly acid. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>R. aromatica, var. trilobata</i>,
Gray. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dakota to Texas, and west to California and
Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The dense foliage of these little bushes has a strong odor,
which is not altogether agreeable, while their small fruit has a
pleasant acid taste, and is much relished by the Indians.</p>

<p>Dr. Edward Palmer writes that this shrub furnishes the Indians
of Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Southern California
with one of the most valuable of basket materials. The young
twigs, which are much tougher than those of the willow, are
soaked, scraped, and split. The baskets are then built up
of a succession of small rolls of grass, over which the split
twigs are closely and firmly bound. The baskets thus made
are very durable, will hold water, and are often used to cook
in, by dropping hot stones into them till the food is done. The
wood exhales a peculiar odor, which is always recognizable
about the camps of these Indians, and never leaves articles
made from it.</p>

<p>This is grown in England as an ornamental shrub.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN STARS.</h3>

<h4><i>Bloomeria aurea</i>, Kell. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulb.</i>&mdash;Six lines in diameter. <i>Leaf.</i>&mdash;Solitary; about equaling the
scape; three to six lines broad. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Six to eighteen inches high.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow; fifteen to sixty in an umbel. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;About an
inch across. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; with cup-shaped appendages. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style club-shaped. Stigma three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Coast Ranges, from Monterey to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as the floral procession begins to slacken a little before
the oncoming of summer, the fields suddenly blossom out anew
and twinkle with millions of the golden stars of the <i>Bloomeria</i>.
These plants are closely allied to the <i>Brodiæas</i>, and by some
authorities are classed as such. They are especially characterized
by the structure of the stamens, which rise out of a
tiny cup. Under a glass this cup is seen to be granular,
somewhat flattened, and furnished with two cusps, or points.
The anthers are a very pretty Nile or peacock green.</p>

<div class="image" id="f054"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f054.png">GOLDEN STARS&mdash;<i>Bloomeria aurea</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>B. Clevelandi</i>, Wats.&mdash;is easily distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[ 156]</a></span>
from the above by its numerous narrow leaves and
its green-nerved perianth. This is found at San Diego, upon
the mesas in midspring, growing abundantly in spots which,
earlier in the season, have been mud-holes. Its open flowers
are so outnumbered by the numerous undeveloped green buds,
that, even though it grows in masses, it is not very showy, but
makes the ground a dull yellow. But its flower-clusters are
feathery and delicate.</p>

<p>There is another plant which closely resembles the <i>Bloomerias</i>.
This is the "golden Brodiæa"&mdash;<i>Brodiæa ixioides</i>,
Wats. But the filaments, instead of having a cuplike appendage,
are winged, with the little anthers swinging prettily upon
their summits. This is found in the Coast Ranges, from Santa
Barbara northward, also in the Sierras. It is a beautiful flower;
especially when seen starring the velvet alpine meadows in
August.</p>

<p>Another plant&mdash;<i>Brodiæa lactea</i>, Wats.&mdash;the "white Brodiæa"
has flowers similar to the above, but pure white (sometimes
lilac), with a green mid-vein. This is common in late
spring from Monterey to British Columbia.</p>


<h3>YELLOW SWEET CLOVER.</h3>

<h4><i>Melilotus parviflora</i>, Desf. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely naturalized from Europe.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early summer the breezes come laden with fragrance
from the sweet clover. This is easily recognized by its tall
stems, its fragrant leaves, with three small, toothed leaflets,
and its small crowded racemes of minute yellow flowers a line
long.</p>

<p>A white form&mdash;<i>Melilotus alba</i>, Lam.&mdash;is found in the
north. Its flowers are vanilla-scented.</p>

<p>This plant is a highly valued remedy in the pharmacop&#339;ia
for various ailments, and its sweet-scented flowers have been
used for flavoring many products, such as Gruyère cheese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[ 157]</a></span>
snuff, and tobacco. In Europe the blossoms are packed
among furs to give them a pleasant odor and keep away
moths.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN COMPASS-PLANT. SUNFLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Wyethia angustifolia</i>, Nutt. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Long-lanceolate;
pointed at both ends; the radical and lower ones six to twelve inches
long; the upper sessile, shorter, and often broader. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Yellow;
composed of ray- and disk-flowers. Plume-like styles of the
latter conspicuous. <i>Ray flowers.</i>&mdash;Numerous; one inch long; six lines
wide; early deciduous. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Broadly campanulate, of numerous
erect, loose, foliaceous, ciliate scales, in several rows. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Monterey,
east to the Sierra foothills and north to Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>In late spring our open plains and hillsides are often plentifully
sown with the large golden flowers of these Californian
compass-plants, called "sunflowers" by many people. There
is a belief prevalent that their erect leaves always stand with
their edges pointing north and south, whence the common
name. This trait is said to be true of all the species.</p>

<p><i>W. helenioides</i>, Nutt., has large, broad leaves, which are
white-woolly when young. Its flower-heads are often four
inches or more across.</p>

<p>This plant is used as a common domestic remedy for coughs
and colds by Californian housewives, and goes under the unmerited
name of "poison-weed." It has also been adopted
among physicians as an officinal drug. The root, which is
slightly bitter and aromatic, is made into a tincture and administered
for asthma, throat disorders, and epidemic influenza,
with excellent results. It blooms in early spring, and is common
upon hillsides.</p>

<p>Another species, very similar to the above, is <i>W. glabra</i>,
Gray. This may be known by its smooth green leaves, which
are often very viscid. It is found from Marin County southward,
in the Coast Ranges, and probably northward.</p>

<p><i>W. mollis</i>, Gray, or "Indian wheat," is very abundant in
the Sierras, growing all through the open woods, and covering
great tracts of dry gravelly soil. Its large, coarse, somewhat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[ 158]</a></span>
woolly radical leaves stand erect and clustered, usually having
a flower-stalk or two in their midst, bearing some smaller
leaves, and several yellow flower-heads, which resemble small
sunflowers with yellow centers. It has a strong odor, and
gives a characteristic smell to the region where it grows. The
common name, "Indian wheat," has been bestowed upon it
not because it in the least resembles wheat, but because the
Indians gather the seed in great quantities and grind it into a
flour.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN SLIPPERY-ELM.</h3>

<h4><i>Fremontia Californica</i>, Torr. Hand-tree Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or trees from two to twenty feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; round-cordate to round-ovate; moderately three- to five-lobed
or cleft; woolly or whitish beneath; the larger two inches wide. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Short-peduncled
on very short lateral branches; numerous; one to
three inches across; having three to five small bractlets. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Corolla-like;
brilliant gold, five-cleft nearly to the base; the lobes having
a rounded, hairy pit at base. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Wanting. <i>Filaments.</i>&mdash;United
to their middle; each bearing a linear, adnate, curved, two-celled
anther. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. Style filiform. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry Sierra
foothills, from Lake County southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>No more beautiful sight is often seen than a slope covered
with the wild slippery-elm in blossom. The bushes are almost
obscured from view by the masses of large golden flowers.
This shrub takes on various forms; sometimes sending out in
every direction long slender branches, which are solid wreaths
of the magnificent blooms; and again assuming a more erect,
treelike habit. It has been hailed with delight in the gardens
of our Southern States, and heartily welcomed in France and
England. Why do not <i>we</i> honor it with a place in our own
gardens, instead of giving room to so many far less beautiful
exotics?</p>

<p>It flowers in early summer, and its season of bloom is said
to last only about two weeks, but the brilliant hibiscus-like
blossoms, drying upon their stems, maintain for a long time a
semblance of their first beauty. The branches are tough and
flexible, and are often cut for whips by teamsters. Among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[ 160]</a></span>
mountaineers it is generally known as "leatherwood." But
this name properly belongs to another entirely different plant,
<i>Dirca palustris</i>.</p>
<div class="image" id="f055"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f055.png">CALIFORNIAN SLIPPERY-ELM&mdash;<i>Fremontia Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The bark of the <i>Fremontia</i> so closely resembles that of the
slippery-elm in taste and other qualities, that it is difficult to
distinguish between them; and it is used in the same manner
for making poultices.</p>

<p>We are told that this shrub thrives best upon a disintegrated
granite soil, and reaches its finest development upon the arid
slopes bordering such rainless regions as the Mojave Desert.
It was first discovered by General Fremont when crossing the
Sierras, about half a century ago, and was named in his honor.
It is closely related to the mallows.</p>


<h3>DODDER. LOVE-VINE. GOLDEN-THREAD.</h3>

<h4><i>Cuscuta</i>, Tourn. Morning-Glory Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Leafless plants with filiform, yellow or orange-colored stems; germinating
in the soil; soon breaking off and becoming parasitic upon
other plants. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; white; densely clustered. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Usually
five-cleft or parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular or campanulate; four- or
five-toothed or lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;On the corolla, alternate with its
lobes. Filaments with fringed scales below. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Globose; two-celled.
Styles two.</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  "while everywhere</span>
<span class="ni">The love-vine spreads a silken snare,</span>
<span class="ni">The tangles of her yellow hair."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Though popularly known as the love-vine, because of its
clinging habit, it must be confessed that this pernicious plant
in no respect merits the title. On the other hand, it might
with propriety be called the octopus of the plant world. If
you break a branch from a plant which has become its victim,
you can see how it has twined itself about it, drawing its very
life-blood from it at every turn, by means of ugly, wartlike
suckers.</p>

<p>It is no wonder, however, that people are generally deceived
as to the moral character of this plant&mdash;for it is indeed a beautiful
sight, when it spreads its golden tangle over the chamisal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[ 161]</a></span>
wild buckwheat, and other plants, often completely hiding them
from view.</p>

<p>We have a number of species. <i>C. salina</i> often covers our
salt marshes with brilliant patches of orange.</p>


<h3>LARGE YELLOW LUPINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Lupinus arboreus</i>, Sims. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby; four to ten feet high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Large; in a loose,
whorled raceme; sulphur-yellow; very fragrant. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Four to
eleven; generally about nine; narrowly lanceolate; nine to twenty lines
long. <i>Pods.</i>&mdash;Two to three inches long; ten- to twelve-seeded; silky
pubescent. (See <i>Lupinus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common from the Sacramento to
San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The large yellow lupine is a common plant upon our wind-swept
mesas, growing in sandy soil. Its shrubby form, somewhat
silvery foliage, and large canary-colored, very fragrant
flowers make it always a conspicuous and beautiful plant.</p>

<p>This species, together with <i>L. albifrons</i>, have been found
most useful in anchoring the shifting sands of the dunes near
San Francisco. It was accidentally discovered in a deep cutting
that these lupines sent their roots down sometimes twenty
feet, and the idea was conceived of making use of them in the
above manner. Barley, which grows more rapidly than the
lupine, was sown to protect the plants while very young. In a
single year the lupines covered the sands with a dense growth,
two or three feet high, sufficient to prevent them from shifting
during the severest storms, and to allow of the subsequent
planting of various pines, willows, and other trees. Thus the
way was prepared for one of the most beautiful of pleasure-grounds&mdash;the
Golden Gate Park of San Francisco which
can hardly be rivaled anywhere for natural situation and diversity
of scene.</p>

<p>One of our handsomest species is <i>L. Stiveri</i>, Kell., found
in the Yosemite. Its blossoms have yellow standards and
rose-colored wings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[ 162]</a></span></p>


<h3>ST. JOHN'S-WORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Hypericum concinnum</i>, Benth. St. John's-wort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to eighteen inches high; branching from a woody
base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; often in four ranks; linear to oblong; six
lines to an inch or more long; usually folded; translucently dotted.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Golden yellow; over an inch across. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five;
margins black-dotted. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous; in three bunches.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Usually three-celled. Styles three. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Central California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as spring is merging into summer, we may look for
the bright golden flowers of our common St. John's-wort.
The numerous stamens give these blossoms a feathery appearance,
and the leaves often group themselves characteristically
in four ranks upon the stems.</p>

<p>All the plants of the genus are known as St. John's-wort,
because certain of the species were supposed to flower upon
the anniversary of this saint. Perhaps there are no other
plants around which tradition has thrown such a glamour.
Mr. Dyer says, in his interesting book, "The Folk-Lore of
Plants," that the St. John's-wort was supposed to be an excellent
amulet against lightning, and that it had the magic property
of revealing the presence of witches; whence in Germany
it was extensively worn on St. John's Eve, when the air was
supposed to be peopled with witches and evil spirits, who
wandered abroad upon no friendly errands. In Denmark it
is resorted to by anxious lovers who wish to divine their future.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN DICENTRA.</h3>

<h4><i>Dicentra chrysantha</i>, Hook. and Arn. Bleeding-heart Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Glaucous and smooth; two to five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;The
larger ones a foot long or more; finely dissected into small linear
lobes. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Erect; yellow; six to nine lines long; in a loose terminal
panicle a foot or two long. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two; small; caducous.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Flattened and cordate; of two pairs of petals; the outer
larger, saccate at base, and with spreading tips; the inner much narrower,
spoon-shaped, their tips cohering and inclosing the anthers and
stigma. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style slender. Stigma
two-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry hills, Lake County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f056"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[ 163]</a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f056.png">ST. JOHN'S-WORT&mdash;<i>Hypericum concinnum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The arrangement of the essential organs in the genus <i>Dicentra</i>
is very curious and interesting. The six stamens are borne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[ 164]</a></span>
in two companies of three each, which stand in front of the
outer petals, and have their filaments more or less united at
the base. The central stamen in each group has a two-celled
anther, while its neighbor on either hand has but a one-celled
anther. The stigma-lobes often bend downward prettily, like
the flukes of a little anchor.</p>

<p>To this genus belongs the beautiful Oriental bleeding-heart
of the garden; and we have two or three interesting native
species.</p>

<p><i>D. chrysantha</i> is usually a somewhat coarse plant, lacking
the grace of <i>D. formosa</i>, the Californian bleeding-heart. The
pale leaves, which are minutely and delicately dissected, are
suggestive of the fronds of certain Japanese ferns. But the
flower-stalks are often stiff and sparsely flowered, and the blossoms,
which are erect, not pendulous, have an <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'over-powering'">overpowering</ins>
narcotic odor, much like that of the poppy. These plants may
be found upon dry hillsides or in sandy washes in early summer,
where the brilliant yellow blossoms are quite conspicuous.
One view of these flowers is not unlike the conventionalized
tulip.</p>

<p>This species is said to thrive well in cultivation and make a
very effective plant when grown in rich garden soil.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN DANDELION.</h3>

<h4><i>Troximon grandiflorum</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Herbs with woody tap-root and milky juice. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical;
lanceolate or oblanceolate; mostly laciniately pinnatifid. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;One
to two and one half feet high. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary; two inches or so
across; of strap-shaped yellow rays only. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Of several
series of imbricated scales, the outer foliaceous and loose. <i>Receptacle.</i>&mdash;Mostly
naked; pitted. <i>Akenes.</i>&mdash;Two lines long; tapering into a
filiform beak six or eight lines long, surmounted by a tuft of silk. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Washington
to Southern California near the Coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>The common dandelion of the East has found its way into
our lawns, but it never adapts itself as a wild plant to the vicissitudes
of our dry summer climate. Nature has given us a
dandelion of our own, of a different genus, which is quite as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[ 165]</a></span>
beautiful, though its flowers are not so vivid a gold. They are
larger than those of the Eastern plant, and are borne upon
taller stems. In early summer the large, ethereal globes of the
ripened seed are conspicuous objects, hovering over our straw-tinted
fields.</p>

<p>Mr. Burroughs writes of the dandelion:&mdash;"After its first
blooming, comes its second and finer and more spiritual inflorescence,
when its stalk, dropping its more earthly and carnal
flower, shoots upward and is presently crowned by a globe of
the most delicate and aerial texture. It is like the poet's
dream, which succeeds his rank and golden youth. This
globe is a fleet of a hundred fairy balloons, each one of which
bears a seed which it is destined to drop far from the parent
source."</p>

<p>If gathered just before they open and allowed to expand in
the house, these down-globes will remain perfect for a long
time and make an exquisite adornment for some delicate vase.</p>

<p>We have several other species of <i>Troximon</i>, but this is our
finest.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4><i>Hosackia bicolor</i>, Dougl. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Smooth throughout; erect; two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;With rather
large, scarious, triangular stipules; pinnate. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Five to nine;
obovate or oblong; six to twelve lines long. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Three- to
seven-flowered; naked or with a small scarious, one- to three-leaved
bract. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Seven lines long. <i>Calyx-teeth.</i>&mdash;Triangular; half
as long as the tube. <i>Standard.</i>&mdash;Yellow; wings and keel white.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine united; one free. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Linear; nearly two inches
long; acute. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Middle California to the State of Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>The yellow and white blossoms of this pretty <i>Hosackia</i> are
quite showy, and are usually found upon low ground near the
seaboard.</p>

<p>Another similar species, also having a yellow standard and
white wings and keel, is <i>H. Torreyi</i>, Gray. This is more or
less silky pubescent; its wings are not spreading, its leaflets are
narrower, and the bract of the umbel is sessile. This is found
along shaded stream-banks both in the higher Coast Ranges
and in the Sierras, and blooms in summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[ 166]</a></span></p>

<p><i>H. gracilis</i>, Benth., with the standard yellow and the widespreading
wings and shorter keel of rose-color, occurs in moist
meadows along the coast from Monterey to the Columbia. It
blooms by the middle of April.</p>

<p><i>H. crassifolia</i>, Benth., a very large species, two or three feet
high, with greenish-yellow or purplish flowers, is abundant in
the Yosemite Valley about the borders of meadows. It is also
common in the foothill region.</p>


<h3>SKUNK-CABBAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Lysichiton Camtschatcensis</i>, Schott. Arum Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Thick; horizontal. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; oblong-lanceolate;
acute; one to three feet or more long; three to ten inches broad;
narrowed to a short petiole or sessile. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small, crowded
on a spadix, at the summit of a stout peduncle becoming six to twelve
inches long. <i>Spadix.</i>&mdash;With an erect, spoon-shaped spathe, one and
one-half to two feet long; bright yellow. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Four-lobed.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four. Filaments short, flat. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Conical; two-celled.
Stigma depressed. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Fleshy, coalescent and sunk in the rachis.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Peat bogs; from Mendocino County northward to Alaska; also,
perhaps, in the Rocky Mountains.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our northwestern counties, before the frost is entirely
out of the ground, the leaves of the skunk-cabbage may be
seen pushing their way up through the standing water of
marshy localities. They soon attain a great size, and resemble
the leaves of the banana-tree. They are of a rich velvet-green,
slightly mottled, and are said to rival some of the tropical productions
of our greenhouses.</p>

<p>There seems to be a difference of opinion as to the disagreeableness
of these leaves. I suspect the odor lies mostly
in the slimy, soapy sap, and is not very noticeable if they are
not bruised or cut.</p>

<p>When the plants are in bloom, in May and June, they are
very handsome, the large spoon-shaped, golden spathes being
conspicuous at some distance. As this spathe withers away,
the flower-stalk continues to grow, and its little greenish-yellow
blossoms become brown.</p>

<div class="image" id="f057"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f057.png"><i>Hosackia gracilis.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The peppery root is highly esteemed for medicinal purposes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[ 168]</a></span>
and is gathered and made into a salve, which is considered
a specific for ringworm, white swelling, inflammatory
rheumatism, etc. The root is said to enter largely into the
composition of a patent medicine called "Skookum."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson, of the U.S. Forestry Department in Oregon,
tells me that the bears are very fond of this root, and dig
industriously for it, often making a hole large enough to bury
themselves, and he mentions having seen whole fields plowed
up by them in their search for it.</p>

<p>This plant belongs to the same family as the skunk-cabbage
of the East and the calla-lily. It has been found in the Santa
Cruz Mountains.</p>


<h3>BLAZING-STAR.</h3>

<h4><i>Mentzelia lævicaulis</i>, Torr. and Gray. Loasa or Blazing-star Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; two or three feet high; white. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
sessile; lanceolate; sinuate-toothed; two to eight inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Sessile,
on short branches; light yellow or cream-color; three or
four inches across. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Cylindrical; naked; limb five-cleft
nearly to the base. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;About ten; oblanceolate; acute. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous
on the calyx; almost equaling the petals. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled;
truncate at summit. Style three-cleft. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Fifteen
lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Diego to the Columbia River, and eastward to
Wyoming.</p></blockquote>

<p>After most other flowers have departed, the magnificent
blossoms of the <i>Mentzelia</i> come forth. It seems as though
they had waited for the firmament to be clear of other stars
before bursting upon the sight. Their enormous blossoms are
crowned by the soft radiance of the long stamens, "like the
lashes of light that trim the stars."</p>

<p>These plants are furnished with barbed hairs, which cause
them to cling to whatever they come in contact with. They
are of tall and spreading habit, and are often found in the dry
beds of streams, where their flowers open in the daytime&mdash;unlike
those of <i>M. Lindleyi</i>, which open at night.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f058.png">BLAZING-STAR&mdash;<i>Mentzelia Lindleyi</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>M. Lindleyi</i>, Torr. and Gray, is one of the most brilliantly
radiant of all our flowers. Its charming blossoms, which open
on the edge of evening, are of a delicate silken texture, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[ 170]</a></span>
of the richest gold. When the flowers first open, the stamens
lie flat upon the petals; but they gradually rise up, forming a
large tuft in the center of the flower. The faded sepals crown
the long seed-vessel, like the flame of the conventional torch
seen in old pictures. This grows in the Monte Diablo Range;
and Niles and Alum Rock are convenient places to find it. It
is cultivated in Eastern gardens under the name of <i>Bartonia
aurea</i>.</p>


<h3>STONECROP.</h3>

<h4><i>Sedum spathulifolium</i>, Hook. Stonecrop or Orpine Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; fleshy; spatulate; six to ten lines long; sessile;
crowded in rosettes at the ends of the decumbent branches. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Four
to six inches high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In compound, one-sided, loose
cymes; their parts four or five; pale-yellow. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;United at base.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate; three lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twice the number
of the petals. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Equaling the number of the petals; attenuate
into the short styles. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Middle California
to Vancouver Island.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blooming somewhat earlier than the "hen-and-chickens,"
but in similar situations, the stonecrop often clothes rock-masses
with beautiful color. The common name, "orpine,"
was given on account of the yellow, or orpine, flowers; and
the name "stonecrop," from its always growing in stony
places.</p>


<h3>PRICKLY-PEAR. TUNA.</h3>

<h4><i>Opuntia Engelmanni</i>, Salm. Cactus Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Erect, bushy, spreading shrubs without leaves, with flattened stems
produced in successive, compressed oval Joints. <i>Joints.</i>&mdash;Six to twelve
inches long; studded sparsely with bundles of stout spines. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
sessile; yellow or red; about three inches across. <i>Sepals</i>, petals,
and stamens numerous in many series, their cohering bases coating
the one-celled ovary and forming a cup above it. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Spreading.
Style one, with several stigmas. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Purple; oval; pulpy; juicy;
two inches long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southern California, Los Angeles, San
Diego, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p>The genus <i>Opuntia</i> is divided into two sections, consisting
respectively of flat-stemmed and cylindrical-stemmed plants,
the former commonly known as "prickly-pear," or "tuna,"
the latter as <i>Cholla cactus</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[ 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the former, <i>O. Engelmanni</i> is our commonest wild
species. It is the one seen from the car-windows growing in
great patches upon the Mojave Desert, and it is abundant
upon dry hills all through the south. There are two varieties
of it&mdash;<i>var. occidentalis</i>, Engelm., the form prevalent in the
interior, and <i>var. littoralis</i>, Engelm., found upon the sea-coast
from Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p>

<p>These plants have a very leathery, impermeable skin, from
which evaporation takes place but slowly, which enables them
to inhabit arid regions. The fruit is sweet and edible, and
the Indians, who are especially fond of it, dry large quantities
for winter use. They make of the fresh fruit a sauce, by long-continued
boiling, which they regard as especially nutritious
and stimulating after it is slightly fermented. They also roast
the leaves in hot ashes and eat the slimy, sweet substance
which is left after the outer skin and thorns have been removed.</p>

<p>Cattle-men of the southern plains plant the different species
as hedges about their corrals, and feed the succulent joints to
their stock after burning off the spines.</p>

<p>Several Mexican species were planted in the early days
about the Missions by the Padres, as defensive hedges, and
remnants of these redoubtable fortifications, ten to fifteen feet
high, are still to be seen stretching for miles through our
southern fields.</p>

<p>In Mexico the <i>Opuntia tuna</i> is largely cultivated for the
rearing of cochineal insects.</p>


<h3>VENEGASIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Venegasia carpesioides</i>, DC. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Several feet high; leafy to the top. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; slenderly
petioled; cordate or ovate-deltoid; crenate; two to four inches long;
thin. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Large; two-inches across, including the rays;
yellow; slender-peduncled; composed of ray- and disk-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Over
an inch long; six lines wide; two- or three-toothed; fertile;
about fifteen. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Broad; of many roundish-green scales; becoming
scarious inward. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Santa Barbara and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This plant, with its ample thin leaves and large yellow
flowers, would arrest the attention anywhere. It often grows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[ 172]</a></span>
under the shade of trees in cool cañons, where its blossoms
brighten the twilight gloom. It is an admirable plant, and has
but one drawback&mdash;its rather unpleasant odor. It is the only
species of the genus which was named in honor of an early
Jesuit missionary, Michael Venegas. It is especially abundant
and beautiful about Santa Barbara.</p>


<h3>FALSE PIMPERNEL.</h3>

<h4><i>Hypericum anagalloides</i>, Cham. and Schlecht. St. John's-wort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Numerous; weak; low; spreading; rooting at the joints.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two to six lines long; oblong to round; clasping. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Three
or four lines across; salmon-colored. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Fifteen to
twenty. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Lower California to British
Columbia, eastward into Montana.</p></blockquote>

<p>In moist places the prostrate stems of this little plant often
make dense mats.</p>

<p>Its specific name indicates its resemblance to the Anagallis,
or pimpernel. In fact, one might easily imagine it a pimpernel
with salmon-colored flowers.</p>


<h3>CANCER-ROOT. NAKED BROOM-RAPE.</h3>

<h4><i>Aphyllon fasciculatum</i>, Gray. Broom-rape Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Leafless parasitic plants. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Scaly; thickened and knotty
below, and bearing on their summits few or many clustered, one-flowered
peduncles of about the same length. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellowish;
sometimes purplish or reddish outside. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Slenderly five-toothed.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular; over an inch long, with five spreading
lobes; somewhat bilabiate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in pairs; included.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style slender. Stigma two-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
California, eastward to Lake Superior.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are about half a dozen species of cancer-root known
upon our Coast, all strange-looking, leafless plants, of very
doubtful moral character&mdash;for I fear it must be confessed
they are thieves. Stealthily sending their roots down and
imbedding them in the roots of their victims, they draw from
them the nourishment needed for their sustenance. But they
have been overtaken by the proper retributive punishment&mdash;for
having no longer any need of organs for the elaboration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[ 174]</a></span>
nourishment, they are denied green leaves, the most beautiful
adornment of many plants; and even the flowers of some of
them seem to us to have a sickly, unwholesome hue. However,
it must be acknowledged that these plants are quite
interesting, despite their evil ways.</p>

<div class="image" id="f059"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f059.png">CANCER-ROOT&mdash;<i>Aphyllon fasciculatum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>A. fasciculatum</i> usually blooms in early summer, on dry,
rocky hills, and is parasitic upon the roots of sagebrush, wild
buckwheat, etc.</p>


<h3>YELLOW MARIPOSA TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus luteus</i>, Dougl. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Four to twelve inches high; bearing a single bulblet inclosed
in the stem-sheath. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Very narrow; one to three lines
wide. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Erect; cup-shaped; yellow; small; not oculated, but
the petals striated with brown lines, especially on the middle third.
<i>Gland.</i>&mdash;Transversely oblong to lunate; densely hairy with orange-colored
ascending hairs, with scattered spreading hairs about it. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Broad
at the base; tapering upward. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Clay soil; Coast
Ranges from Mendocino County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The typical <i>C. luteus</i>, as described above, is the least beautiful
of all the Mariposa tulips, being lower of stature and
smaller of flower than most of the others; but among its varieties
may be found some of the most charming flowers of the
genus, the true butterfly-tulips of the early Spanish, often oculated
and marked in a wonderful manner. In color and marking
they often run closely into forms of <i>C. venustus</i>, the only
constant characters by which to distinguish them being found
in the shape of the gland and the capsule and the character of
the soil in which they grow.</p>

<p>There are two well-marked varieties&mdash;<i>citrinus</i> and <i>oculatus</i>&mdash;besides
numerous other forms, where the species seems to
have run riot in color and marking. The <i>var. citrinus</i> is a
strong, vigorous-growing plant, with flowers of a deep lemon-yellow,
with a large, distinct, very dark maroon eye on each
petal. It is exceedingly beautiful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[ 175]</a></span></p>


<h3>SILVER-WEED. CINQUEFOIL.</h3>

<h4><i>Potentilla Anserina</i>, L. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Prostrate. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; a foot or so long; pinnate,
with seven to twenty-one leaflets with smaller ones interposed.
<i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Sessile; oblong; toothed; shining green; silvery beneath.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright yellow; long-peduncled; solitary; an inch across.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five; with five bractlets between. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twenty
to twenty-five. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Numerous; on a hairy receptacle.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout North America.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bright golden blossoms of the silver-weed are common
in moist places, haunting stream-banks, lingering about stagnant
ponds, or even pushing their way up amid the grasses of
our salt marshes. The white under-surfaces of the leaves are
responsible for one of the common names of this plant.</p>

<p><i>P. glandulosa</i>, Lindl., is found upon dry hillsides. It is
one or two feet high, and is an ill-smelling, somewhat sticky
plant, with glandular hairs. The stems are leafy, and the small
flowers, like pale-yellow strawberry-blossoms, are produced in
loose clusters. The corolla scarcely exceeds the calyx. The
leaves, which have from five to nine leaflets, have not the silvery
under-surface of those of <i>P. Anserina</i>.</p>


<h3>COMMON EVENING PRIMROSE.</h3>

<h4><i>&#338;nothera biennis</i>, L. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; usually simple; one to five feet high; more or less
hairy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly sessile; lanceolate to oblong; two to six inches
long; denticulate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Golden yellow; in a leafy spike; erect in
the bud. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Twelve to thirty lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Six to
nine lines long. <i>Stigma-lobes.</i>&mdash;Linear. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;An inch or less
long. (See <i>&#338;nothera</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the United States.</p></blockquote>

<p>The common evening primrose is a very widespread plant
in the United States, and it has long been in cultivation in Europe.
Its flowers open suddenly at night, and, according to
tradition, with a popping noise. Referring to this, the poet
Keats speaks of&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"A turf of evening primroses,</span>
<span class="ni">O'er which the mind may hover till it dozes;</span>
<span class="ni">O'er which it well might take a pleasant sleep,</span>
<span class="ni">But that 'tis ever startled by the leap</span>
<span class="i0">Of buds into ripe flowers."</span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[ 176]</a></span></p>

<p>These blossoms are said to be luminous at night, shining by
the sunlight they have stored during the daytime.</p>

<p>The young roots, which are edible, are excellent, either
pickled or boiled, having a nutty flavor. In Germany and
France these are used, either stewed or raw, in salads, like
celery; and the young mucilaginous twigs are also used in the
same way. A tincture of the whole plant is a valued remedy
in medicine for many disorders. Our Californian plants are
mostly of the <i>var. hirsutissima</i>, Gray, having very large flowers
and a hairy capsule.</p>


<h3>GUM-PLANT. RESIN-WEED. AUGUST-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Grindelia cuneifolia</i>, Nutt. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Bushy; two to four feet high; smooth. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Cuneate-spatulate
to linear-oblong; leathery; three or four inches long. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
terminating the branches; yellow; composed of disk- and
ray-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;One inch long. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Hemispherical; of
numerous scales, with spreading tips. <i>Buds</i>.&mdash;Covered with a milky
gum. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Grindelia robusta, var. angustifolia</i>, Gray. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
Santa Barbara northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Grindelias</i> are especially characteristic of the region
west of the Mississippi River, and are all known as "gum-plant,"
or "resin-weed," owing to the balsamic exudation
which is found mostly upon the flower-heads. We have several
species, all of which are rather difficult of determination.</p>

<p>Before the occupation of California by the whites, the value
of these plants was known to the Indians, who used them in
pulmonary troubles, and as a wash in cases of oak-poisoning
or other skin-diseases. They are now made into a drug by
our own people, who use them in the same manner as the
aborigines.</p>

<p>By the middle of August our salt marshes are gay with the
bright yellow flowers.</p>

<div class="image" id="f060"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f060.png">GUM-PLANT&mdash;<i>Grindelia cuneifolia</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Every year men are sent out to gather the plant. Only
about five or six inches of the tops of the branches are cut, as
the resin is found mostly there in the form of a white gum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[ 178]</a></span>
Tons of these shoots are shipped East annually, to be returned
to us later in the form of the medicine called "grindelia."</p>

<p><i>Grindelia hirsutula</i>, Hook. and Arn., is a pretty species,
flowering in early summer upon hill-slopes. This may be
known by its reddish stems and more slender and fewer ray-flowers.</p>


<h3>SULPHUR-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Eriogonum umbellatum</i>, Torr. Buckwheat Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; obovate to oblong-spatulate; two inches or
less long; mostly smooth above; sometimes woolly below. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Three
to twelve inches high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Sulphur-yellow; two or three
lines long; many contained in each little top-shaped involucre, on
threadlike stems. <i>Involucres.</i>&mdash;Two lines or so long; deeply cleft, the
lobes becoming reflexed. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Six-parted. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Triangular; one-celled. <i>Styles.</i>&mdash;Three. Stigmas capitate.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mountains of Middle and Northern California, and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Large companies of the sulphur-flower may be seen in the
Sierras in July and August, where it covers open, dry, rocky
slopes, making brilliant masses of color.</p>

<p>Growing with this is often found another species&mdash;<i>E. ursinum</i>,
Wats.&mdash;with flowers of a beautiful translucent cream-color,
often tinged with pink.</p>


<h3>WILD BOUVARDIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Gilia grandiflora</i>, Gray. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Erect; a foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two or three inches
long; linear or oblong-lanceolate; sessile. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Salmon-color;
crowded at the summit of the stem. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With obconic tube and
broad, obtuse lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Narrowly funnel-form, with tube an inch
long, and five-lobed border almost as broad. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely
distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This plant was formerly placed in the genus <i>Collomia</i>; but
that genus was not well founded, and all its species have now
been transferred to <i>Gilia</i>. From the resemblance of its showy
buff or salmon-colored flowers to the <i>Bouvardias</i> of our gardens,
these plants are popularly known as "wild Bouvardia."
The blossoms are found in early summer, and grow usually in
dry places, exposed to the sun.</p>

<h3>LITTLE ALPINE LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium parvum</i>, Kell. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulbs.</i>&mdash;Small; of short, thick, jointed scales. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Slender;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[ 180]</a></span>
eighteen inches to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Scattered, or in whorls;
two to five inches long; an inch or less broad; rich green. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Orange-vermilion,
dotted with purple; two to fifty; scattered or somewhat
whorled. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Sub-spherical; six to nine lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
High Sierras, from Yosemite Valley to Lake Tahoe.</p></blockquote>

<p>Passing from the parched and dusty plains of our central
valleys in July and August, we are transported as though upon
the magic tapestry of Prince Houssain into a heavenly region
of springtime, where the streams, fed by the snow lying in
shadowy mountain fastnesses, gush through plushy emerald
meadows, starred with millions of daisies and bordered by luxuriant
tangles of larkspurs, columbines, monk's-hoods, lupines,
and a thousand other charming plants&mdash;a veritable flower-lover's
paradise.</p>

<p>Here from the thickets, standing with their roots in the
rich, loamy soil of the brookside, gleam the small orange blossoms
of the little alpine lily&mdash;little only in flower, for the
slender stems often rise to a height of six feet, producing several
whorls of rich green leaves. These lilies are but an inch
or an inch a half long, with their perianth-segments yellow or
orange below and deeper orange-vermilion above, their tips
only being rolled backward.</p>


<h3>GOLDEN YARROW.</h3>

<h4><i>Eriophyllum confertiflorum</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>White-woolly plants, at length smooth. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or two
high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Cuneate in outline; divided into three to seven narrow
linear divisions. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Golden yellow; in densely crowded
flat-topped clusters. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Small; of disk- and ray-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Four
or five; broadly oval or roundish. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Oval; of
about five thin bracts; two lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Francisco to
the Sierras, and southward to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f062"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f062.png">LITTLE ALPINE LILY&mdash;<i>Lilium parvum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>In early summer many a dry, rocky hill-slope is ablaze with
the brilliant flowers of the golden yarrow. The brown-mottled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[ 182]</a></span>
butterfly may often be seen hovering over it, or delicately
poising upon its golden table, fanning his wings.</p>

<p><i>E. cæspitosum</i>, Dougl., is a very handsome species with
solitary golden flower-heads an inch or so across. Its leaves
are broader and not so finely divided, and some of the upper
ones are linear and entire. This is found throughout California.</p>


<h3>TARWEED. WILD COREOPSIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Madia elegans</i>, Don. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Usually viscid throughout. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to six feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Crowded
at the base of the stem; six to ten inches long; small
above. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Of both ray- and disk-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Twelve
to fifteen; one inch long; three-lobed at the apex; yellow,
sometimes with a dark-red base. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;With one series of
scales, each clasping a ray. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California, and in
Oregon and Nevada.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most beautiful of all our tarweeds. Its
golden, Coreopsis-like flowers open after sunset, and close at
the first warmth of the morning rays.</p>

<p>All the <i>Madias</i> are used medicinally by old Spanish settlers.</p>

<p><i>Madia sativa</i>, Molina, is one of our most troublesome
species, because its viscid secretion is so very abundant. The
plants are tall, but the flowers are inconspicuous, owing to the
smallness or absence of the rays. It is native of Chile as well
as of California.</p>

<p>An oil of excellent quality was made from its seeds in that
country before the olive was so abundant.</p>


<h3>LEOPARD-LILY. TIGER-LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium pardalinum</i>, Kell. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Bulbs consisting of forking rhizomes, covered with small, erect imbricated
scales; often forming matted masses. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to ten
feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually whorled, with some scattered above and
below; lanceolate; three to seven inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Few to
many; long-pediceled. <i>Perianth segments.</i>&mdash;Six; two or three inches
long; six to nine lines wide; strongly revolute; with orange base and
reddish or scarlet tips; spotted or dotted with purple on the lower half.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. Anthers versatile. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style club-shaped.
Stigma capitate. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Eighteen lines or more long.</p></blockquote>

British Columbia, and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>No more magnificent sight could be imagined than a cañon-side
covered with a mass of these red and gold blossoms nodding
on their tall stems. The plants often grow in clumps and
colonies of several hundred, and are always found in the rich
soil of stream-banks or of wet, springy places. Most of us
have been familiar with these spotted beauties from our childhood,
with their delicately swinging anthers full of cinnamon-colored
pollen.</p>

<p>A friend writing us from near Mt. Shasta, one July, said:
"I wish you could have seen the <i>grove</i> of tiger-lilies we saw
near the place where we rested and lunched. They sprang
from a velvet bed of mosses and ferns, under the shadow of a
great rock, that towered at least a hundred feet above them.
Out of the rock sprang two streams of living water, ice-cold,
which crossed the trail and dashed over a rock below. Upon
one plant we counted twenty-five buds and blossoms, while a
friend counted thirty-two upon another."</p>

<p>Under extraordinarily favorable conditions, this lily has been
known to reach a height of ten feet.</p>


<h3>YELLOW POND-LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Nuphar polysepalum</i>, Engelm. Water-Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Six to twelve inches long; three fourths as wide; obtuse;
deeply cleft at base; floating or erect. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Floating; three to
five inches across. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Eight to twelve; petaloid; bright yellow,
sometimes greenish without. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Twelve to eighteen; small;
about equaling the stamens, and resembling them. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous;
red; recurved in age; pollen yellow. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Large; eight- to
twenty-celled. Stigma button-shaped; many-rayed; four lines to an
inch across. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Colorado to Central California, and northward
to Alaska.</p></blockquote>

<p>Most of us are familiar with the yellow water-lily, and have
seen its pretty shield-shaped leaves floating upon the surface
of some glassy pond, starred with its large, golden flowers.
The latter are sometimes five inches across and quite showy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[ 185]</a></span>
Sometimes entire marshes are covered with the plants. The
large seeds are very nutritious, and form an important article
of diet among the northern Indians.</p>


<h3>HUMBOLDT'S LILY. TIGER-LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium Humboldtii</i>, Roezl and Leichtlin. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulbs.</i>&mdash;Large; often weighing over a pound; with scales two or
three inches long. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; purplish; three or four feet high;
eight- or ten-flowered, or more. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Wavy-margined; roughish;
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Large; six to eight inches in diameter; golden yellow;
spotted with pale purple, turning to red or brown. <i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Having
papillose prominences near the base. (Otherwise like <i>L. pardalinum</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The foothills of the Sierras; southward to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This wonderful lily, at first glance, resembles the common
leopard- or tiger-lily&mdash;<i>L. pardalinum</i>&mdash;and it is found sometimes
in the same regions as the latter, but never in the same
kind of localities. It affects the loose soil of dry, upland
woods, but never grows in wet or boggy places. Its flowers
are larger than those of <i>L. pardalinum</i>, and have more of a
golden hue and less of red in them.</p>

<p>By July this lily is in full bloom and a magnificent sight.
A plant was once known which had fifty buds and blossoms,
thirty of which were open at once!</p>


<h3>COMMON SUNFLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Helianthus annuus</i>, L. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Hispid, coarse plants. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
alternate; petioled; deltoid-ovate to ovate-lanceolate; acuminate; three
to seven inches long; three-ribbed at base. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Large;
three or four inches across, including the rays; solitary; composed of
yellow ray-flowers and purple-brown, tubular disk-flowers. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Of
several series of imbricated, ovate, acuminate scales. <i>Disk.</i>&mdash;An
inch or so across. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The stately form of the sunflower is a common sight in the
south, where whole fields are often covered with the plants.
Their season of blossoming is supposed to be in the autumn,
but we have seen them blooming just as gayly in March. This
wild sunflower of the plains is believed to be the original parent
of the large sunflower of our gardens.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[ 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Its seeds are used by the Indians as food and in the preparation
of hair-oil.</p>

<p>Popular tradition makes this blossom a worshiper of the
sun, and it is believed to follow him with admiring glances.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="ni">"The lofty follower of the sun,</span>
<span class="ni">Sad when he sets, shuts up her hollow leaves,</span>
<span class="ni">Drooping all night, and when he warm returns,</span>
<span class="ni">Points her enamored bosom to his ray."</span>
</div></div>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>H. Californicus</i>, DC.&mdash;found from San
Francisco Bay southward, along streams, has something the
same habit as the above, but may be known from it by its
slender, smooth stems, leafy to the top, the long, sprawling, awl-shaped
bracts of its involucre, and its more delicate flowers,
about two and a half inches across. The disk-corollas are
slightly pubescent below. This species has a rather strong
balsamic odor.</p>


<h3>PINE-DROPS.</h3>

<h4><i>Pterospora andromedea</i>, Nutt. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high. <i>Bracts.</i>&mdash;Crowded at base; scattered
above. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Three lines long; yellowish.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. Anthers tailed; opening lengthwise. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled.
Style short. Stigma five-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
California, and across the continent.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our walks in the mountains, we occasionally encounter
the flesh-colored wands of this curious plant. The colorless
leaves are reduced to mere bracts, and the stems are densely
clothed above with the little yellowish waxen bells. The
whole plant is very viscid and disagreeable to handle.</p>

<p>Though rare, it is found all across the continent. In the
East it grows only under pine-trees, upon whose roots it is
supposed to be parasitic, while in California it is said to be
found under both oaks and pines.</p>

<p>There is but a single species in this genus. The seed is
furnished with a broad membranous wing, which has given
rise to the name <i>Pterospora</i>, derived from two Greek words,
meaning <i>wing</i> and <i>seed</i>.</p>

<h3>TARWEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Hemizonia luzulæfolia</i>, DC. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Glandular, strong-scented plants. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Loosely branching;]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[ 188]</a></span>
slender; six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear; very small
above; elongated and withering early below. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;White
or light yellow; composed of ray- and disk-flowers. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Six to
ten; two to five lines long; three-lobed. <i>Scales.</i>&mdash;of the involucre each
clasping a ray. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Common throughout the western part of the
State.</p></blockquote>

<p>Under the common designation of "tarweed," plants belonging
to two different genera&mdash;<i>Madia</i> and <i>Hemizonia</i>&mdash;and
comprising thirty or forty species, may be found. They are
mostly annuals or biennials, with viscid, heavily scented foliage,
which make themselves conspicuous in late summer and
through the autumn. The <i>Hemizonias</i> are distinctively Californian;
while the <i>Madias</i> we have in common with Chile.
Their viscid exudation is particularly ruinous to wool and
clothing, but alcohol is a solvent for it, and will generally
remove it.</p>

<p>We wonder how these plants, which flourish in our driest
seasons, can extract so much moisture from the parched earth,
and of what practical use this resinous secretion can be in their
economy. Though some of them are described as having a
disagreeable odor, many of them have a very pleasant balsamic
fragrance, which gives our summer and autumn atmosphere a
peculiar character of its own. Whole fields and hillsides are
tinged with their warm olive foliage, or are yellow with their
golden flowers, which appear like a fall revival of the buttercups.
The flowers open mostly at night or in early morning,
closing in bright sunshine.</p>

<p><i>Hemizonia luzulæfolia</i> is a common species, whose flowers are
redolent of the odor of myrrh.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN GOLDENROD.</h3>

<h4><i>Solidago Californica</i>, Nutt. Composite Family.</h4>

<p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Rather stout; low or tall. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong, or the upper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[ 190]</a></span>
oblong-lanceolate, and the lower obovate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In a dense, pyramidal
panicle, four to twelve inches long, with mostly erect racemose
branches. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Three or four lines long; yellow. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Small;
seven to twelve; about as many as the disk-flowers. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
California, to Nevada and Mexico.</p>

<p>Our State is not so rich in <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'golden-rod'">goldenrods</ins> as New England,
yet we have several rather pretty species. <i>Solidago Californica</i>
is found upon dry hills, and blooms from July to October.
It is said to thrive well under cultivation.</p>

<p>It differs from the "Western <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'golden-rod'">goldenrod</ins>" in having its
flowers in a pyramidal cluster.</p>


<h3>MOTH-MULLEIN.</h3>

<h4><i>Verbascum Blattaria</i>, L. Figwort Family.</h4>

<p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Tall and slender. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; oblong; crenate-toothed;
nearly smooth; the upper ovate, acute, clasping. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellow
or white; purple-tinged; an inch or so across; in a terminal
raceme; the pedicels much exceeding the calyx-lobes. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Wheel-shaped, with five rounded, somewhat unequal
lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. Filaments violet-bearded. Anthers
confluently one-celled. Pollen orange-colored, copious. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
Style slender. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Upper Sacramento Valley,
etc.; naturalized from Europe.</p>

<p>The mulleins are natives of Europe, which have found their
way across the water to us. Two or three species are now
common in some localities. The moth-mullein is so called because
its blossoms have the appearance of a number of delicate
moths resting upon the stem. This is a tall, green plant.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>V. Thapsus</i>, L.&mdash;is also quite common.
In the Sacramento Valley its tall, woolly tapers may be seen leaning
in every direction, giving the fields a disorderly appearance.
This plant abounds throughout Europe and Asia, and
was well known to the ancient Greeks and Romans, who made
lampwicks of its dried leaves and utilized its stalks, dipped in
tallow, for funeral torches. In medieval Europe it was called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[ 191]</a></span>
"hag-taper," because it was employed by witches in their incantations.
In Europe at the present time it is known as the
"American velvet-plant," because of a mistaken idea that it is
a native of this country.</p>


<h3>WESTERN GOLDENROD.</h3>

<h4><i>Solidago occidentalis</i>, Nutt. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Smooth throughout. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Paniculately branched; two to six
feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear; entire; obscurely three-nerved; two to
four inches long; one to three lines wide. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;In numerous
small, flat clusters, terminating the slender branchlets; three lines
long; yellow. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Sixteen to twenty not surpassing the eight to
fourteen disk-flowers. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Of imbricated scales; the outer
successively shorter. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the Coast, from Southern California
to British America.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Western <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'golden-rod'">goldenrod</ins>, with its slender, willowy stems
and small flower-clusters, may be found in wet places in late
summer and early autumn. Its blossoms are acacia-scented.</p>


<h3>CREOSOTE-BUSH. GOBERNADORA. HIDEONDO.</h3>

<h4><i>Larrea Mexicana</i>, Moricand. Creosote-Bush Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Ill-smelling, resinous shrubs, four to ten feet high; diffusely branched.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; with two unequal leaflets. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Three to six
lines long; pointed; sessile. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary; yellow. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five;
silky; deciduous. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; three or four lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
on a small ten-lobed disk. Filaments winged below.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled; Style slender. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Inland deserts of the
southern part of the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most plentiful shrub growing in our southern desert
regions is the creosote-bush, so called because its sticky leaves
burn with a black smoke and a rank odor, between creosote
and carbolic acid.</p>

<p>These shrubs often cover vast tracts of arid soil, and in
places are the only growth to be seen. The evergreen foliage
is of a warm olive tone, and is borne at the ends of many slender,
grayish branches. The small, stemless, opposite leaves,
each divided almost to its base into two leaflets, spread butterfly-like
upon the slender branchlets. The leaf-nodes are swollen
into small, warty prominences, which are especially resinous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[ 192]</a></span></p>

<p>In many localities, especially in Arizona, the branches of
this shrub are thickly incrusted with a certain gummy substance,
which careful examination has proved to be almost identical
with the East Indian shellac of commerce. This is caused by
an insect of the genus <i>Coccus</i>, who stings the young twigs, at
the same time laying its eggs in them, causing them to exude
the gum. Could this gum be collected in sufficient quantities,
it would doubtless prove a valuable article of commerce, probably
not inferior to the East Indian lac. Dr. Edwd. Palmer
writes that it is extensively used by our Indians as a cement
with which to fasten their flint <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'arrow-heads'">arrowheads</ins> to the shafts, to
mend broken pottery, and to make water-tight their baskets,
woven of grass and roots. The plant yields a greenish-yellow
dye, with which they paint their persons and color their fabrics;
but garments so dyed are said to emit a disagreeable odor
always upon being heated.</p>

<p>A lotion made by steeping the branches in water is said to
be an excellent remedy for sores; while the leaves dried and
reduced to powder are effectively used for the same purpose.
Some of our pharmacists say that the plant is a valuable remedy
for rheumatism.</p>

<p>By the Spanish-Californians this shrub is known as "gobernadora"
and "hideondo"; and by the American settlers of the
desert it is known by several uncomplimentary names, among
them the meaningless one of "greasewood."</p>

<p>It blossoms in early summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[ 193]</a></span></p>

<h3>RED-STEMMED FILAREE. ALFILERILLA. CLOCKS.
PIN-CLOVER.</h3>

<h4><i>Erodium cicutarium</i>, L'Her. Geranium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Chiefly radical in a depressed rosette; six to ten inches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[ 194]</a></span>
long; dissected into narrow toothed lobes. Stem-leaves smaller.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink; four to eight in an umbel; parts in fives. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four
lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five perfect, with flattened filaments;
five reduced to mere scales. <i>Carpels</i> and styles one or two inches
long; separating upward from a central axis into twisted, bearded
tails. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The name "alfilerilla" is Spanish, coming from <i>alfiler</i>, a
needle, and refers to the long, slender beak of the carpels. By
corruption it has become "filaree."</p>

<p>This plant is found in abundance everywhere, and is one
of our most valuable forage-plants. It varies greatly in size,
and becomes very rank in growth where the soil is rich.
Ordinarily, it makes its appearance soon after the beginning
of the rainy season, as a rosette of leaves lying upon the
ground, and later it sends up its reddish stems. Its seed-vessels
look like a group of fantastic, long-billed storks, and
the long beaks of the carpels, as they separate from the central
axis, begin to curl about any convenient object. They are
thus widely disseminated in the hair of animals and the clothing
of people. Children call them "clocks," and love to stand
the seed up in their clothing and watch the beaks wind slowly
about, like the hands of a timepiece.</p>

<p>We have several other species of <i>Erodium</i>. <i>E. moschatum</i>,
L' Her., is a coarser plant whose foliage has a musky fragrance,
especially when wilted. It is also a valuable forage-plant and
is commonly known as "musky filaree" or "green-stemmed
filaree."</p>

<p><i>E. Botrys</i>, Bertoloni, is a very abundant plant. Its flowers
are larger, six lines across, and are pink, strongly veined with
wine-color. The beaks of its carpels are sometimes four inches
long.</p>

<h3>REDWOOD-SORREL.</h3>

<h4><i>Oxalis Oregana</i>, Nutt. Geranium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Herbs with sour juice. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;With three leaflets; petioles two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[ 196]</a></span>
to even twelve inches long. Leaflets one or two inches broad; usually
light-blotched. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;One to six inches long; one-flowered.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; nine to twelve lines long; white or rose-colored,
often veined with darker color; usually having an orange
spot at base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. Styles five.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast woods, from Santa Cruz to Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>In deep woods, "where no stir nor call the sacred hush profanes,"
the beautiful leaves and delicate flowers of the redwood-sorrel
cover the ground with an exquisite tapestry, which
catches the shimmer of the sunlight as it sifts down through
the tall trees. If the goddess Nanna in passing left the print
of her pretty fingers upon the clover, perhaps some wood-nymph
may have touched the leaves of this charming plant.
Each day as twilight deepens, the leaflets fold gently together
and prepare to sleep.</p>

<p>The small yellow oxalis&mdash;<i>O. corniculata</i>, L.&mdash;becomes a
troublesome weed in our lawns.</p>


<h3>ROCK-CRESS.</h3>

<h4><i>Arabis blepharophylla</i>, Hook. and Arn. Mustard Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Four to twelve inches high. <i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Broadly
spatulate; one or two inches long. <i>Cauline-leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong; sessile.
<i>All.</i>&mdash;Ciliate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purplish-pink. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Four; generally colored.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; six to nine lines long; clawed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six;
two shorter. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Stigma button-shaped. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Linear;
an inch or more long; flattened. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from San
Francisco to Monterey.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bright magenta-colored blossoms of the rock-cress may
be looked for in early spring along the hills of the Coast
Ranges. This plant is said to be very beautiful in cultivation.
The generic name was bestowed because many of the well-known
species are natives of Arabia, while the formidable
specific name means "eyelash-leaved," referring to the ciliate
leaves.</p>

<h3>WILD HOLLYHOCK.</h3>

<h4><i>Sidalcea malvæflora</i>, Gray. Mallow Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several; eight inches to two feet long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[ 198]</a></span>
in outline; variously lobed and cut. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink; in terminal racemes.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft; without bractlets. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; united at
base; one inch long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;United in a column; in two series.
Anthers one-celled. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Three to ten in a ring; separating at
maturity. Styles as many; filiform. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast from San Diego
to Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early spring the graceful sprays of the <i>Sidalcea</i> bend over
our meadows everywhere, making them bright with their pink
blossoms, which the children call "wild hollyhocks." The
stamens of these flowers are especially pretty and interesting if
examined with a glass. By a careful dissection, the stamen-column
is found to be double, its outer part bearing five bunches
of stamens. The anthers are one-celled and of a beautiful rose-pink.
They may be seen best by pulling apart one of the unopened
buds.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of these plants, one having large pale-pink
flowers, which are perfect; the other bearing smaller deep
rose-pink blossoms, in which the anthers are only rudimentary.</p>

<p>There are quite a number of species of <i>Sidalcea</i> in California,
but they are very difficult of determination for the non-botanist.</p>


<h3>REDBUD. JUDAS-TREE.</h3>

<h4><i>Cercis occidentalis</i>, Torr. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Small trees or shrubs. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; slender-petioled; round-cordate;
palmately veined; smooth; about two inches in diameter.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rose-color; papilionaceous; clustered in the axils. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four
lines long; the standard smaller and inclosed by the wings.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten; all distinct. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Pods.</i>&mdash;Two or
three inches long; thin. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Mt. Shasta to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>By April, or earlier, our interior hills and valleys begin to
show the rosy blossoms of the Judas-tree. The leafless branches
are wreathed with the abundant flowers, which gives the shrub
the appearance of a garden fruit-tree. When seen later, in its
full summer foliage, it is almost equally attractive. Its shapely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[ 200]</a></span>
leaves are then diversified by the clusters of long purple pods,
which hang gracefully among them.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f068.png">WILD HOLLYHOCK&mdash;<i>Sidalcea malvæflora</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Indians find the slender twigs of this shrub very useful
in their basket-making. By means of the thumb-nail or flints,
they split them into threads, which they use as woof.</p>

<p>A closely allied species of <i>Cercis</i>, growing in Palestine, had,
according to tradition, white flowers, until the arch-traitor
Judas hanged himself from its limbs, when it blushed pink for
very shame.</p>

<p>In medieval Europe the Judas-tree was believed to be a
favorite rendezvous for witches, and it was considered dangerous
to approach one at nightfall.</p>


<h3>HUCKLEBERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Vaccinium ovatum</i>, Pursh. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Evergreen shrubs, three to eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate to

<p>When in bloom our Californian huckleberry is a delightful
shrub. Its leaves, which are of a particularly rich, shining
green, are set at a characteristic angle to the red stems, contrasting
finely with their warm tones; and the effect is heightened
by the clusters of small pink and white waxen bells
scattered here and there amid the foliage.</p>

<p>The huckleberry is at its best upon the high ridges of the
Coast Ranges, where it becomes especially luxuriant in the fog-nurtured
region of the northern portion of the redwood belt.
There its abundant berries become juicy and delicious, and are
much sought for preserving and pie-making. Its branches,
when cut, keep admirably in water and are favorite greens for
household decoration.</p>

<h3>STAR-FLOWER. CHICKWEED-WINTERGREEN.</h3>

<h4><i>Trientalis Europæa, var. latifolia</i>, Torr. Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;Tuberous. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Four to eight inches high; with a whorl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[ 202]</a></span>
of oval-pointed leaves one to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White or
pink; eight lines across. <i>Calyx</i> and rotate corolla seven-parted, sometimes
six- to nine-parted; divisions pointed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;As many as
the corolla-lobes, and opposite them. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style filiform.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from Monterey northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In April and May, as we walk through shaded woods, we
begin to notice a trim little plant three or four inches high, with
very slender stem, bearing at its summit a number of pretty
leaves of varying size. A little later, we find among them one
or two delicate pink, starry flowers on very slender, threadlike
stems.</p>

<p>The generic name is from the Latin <i>triens</i>, and is in allusion
to the height of the plant, which is the third part of a foot.</p>


<h3>CLINTONIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Clintonia Andrewsiana</i>, Torr. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical; oblong; six inches to one foot long; two to four
wide. <i>Flower-stem.</i>&mdash;One or two feet high; with one leafy bract.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink; many; in a terminal compound cluster on pedicels an
inch or less long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; four to seven lines long.
<i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Six; gibbous at the base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-
 or three-celled. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Beautiful, large, dark-blue berries. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Coast Ranges, from Santa Cruz to Humboldt County.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the most distinguished-looking plants of our
deep coast woods. Its large leaves, of a rich polished green,
arrange themselves symmetrically around the short stem, seeming
to come from the ground&mdash;and so fine are they, that if no
blossom appeared, we should feel the plant had fulfilled its
mission of beauty. But in April a blossom-stalk shoots up
from their midst, bearing upon its summit a cluster of deep
rose-colored, nodding bells. These are succeeded later by a
bunch of superb dark-blue berries, which might be made of
lapis lazuli or the rarest old delft china. I remember a beautiful
spot upon the Lagunitas Creek, where the stream, flowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[ 203]</a></span>
over a brown, pebbly bottom, passes among the redwoods
where their tall shafts make dim cathedral aisles,&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>Here little yellow violets and the charming wood-sorrel carpet
the ground, the fetid adder's-tongue spreads its mottled leaves,
while groups of the lovely <i>Clintonia</i> put the finishing touches
to an already beautiful scene.</p>


<h3>LEMONADE-BERRY. MAHOGANY.</h3>

<h4><i>Rhus integrifolia</i>, Benth. and Hook. Poison-oak or Cashew Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Evergreen shrubs two to six feet high, becoming small trees southward.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled; one to three inches long;
rigid; leathery. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Of two sexes, also some perfect; in short,
dense terminal clusters one to three inches long; rose-colored or white.
<i>Sepals</i>, petals, and stamens four to nine; usually five. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Rounded;
ciliate; one or two lines across. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Stigmas
three. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Flat; one-seeded; six lines across; red; viscid and
acid. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast from Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>Growing everywhere upon the southern coast in great
abundance, this shrub forms low, dense, wind-shorn thickets.
Farther inland it rises to a height of several feet, with tough,
India-rubber-like branches, and in Lower California it becomes
a small tree. In its better estate it is very ornamental, especially
in spring, when sprinkled with its clusters of small pink
flowers. The little drupes are covered with an acid, oily substance,
and have long been used by the Indians and Mexicans
in the preparation of a lemonade-like drink. These people are
so fond of this fruit that they dry it for winter use, grinding and
roasting it as we do coffee. The wood of these shrubs is of a
dark-red color, which is responsible for the common name,
"mahogany."</p>

<p>Another <i>Rhus</i> very common in the valleys of Southern
California is <i>R. laurina</i>, Nutt., usually called "sumach." It
is an evergreen shrub, with smooth, lanceolate leaves, two or
three inches long, exhaling a rather strong odor, considered by
some like bitter almonds, and bearing dense clusters of small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[ 204]</a></span>
white flowers in midsummer. Its small drupes are only a line
or two across. They are also coated with a waxen substance,
and yield a pungent oil.</p>

<p>In the mountains from Santa Barbara to San Diego is found
another species&mdash;<i>R. ovata</i>, Wats. This has large leathery,
pointed leaves, and is known as "lemonade-and-sugar-tree,"
as the acid berries are coated with a sweet, waxen substance,
which the Indians value as sugar. Its leaves resemble in form
those of the lilacs of our gardens.</p>


<h3>SHOOTING-STARS. WILD CYCLAMEN. MAD VIOLETS.</h3>

<h4><i>Dodecatheon Meadia</i>, L. Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; tufted; from obovate to lanceolate. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Three
to fifteen inches high; umbel two- to twenty-flowered. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply
five-cleft, the divisions reflexed in flower, erect in fruit. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With
extremely short tube, and an abruptly reflexed five-parted
limb; white, rose-color, or purple. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; opposite the
corolla-lobes. Filaments short; united. Anthers standing erect around
the long style, forming a beak; violet. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
the continent; exceedingly variable.</p></blockquote>

<p>The shooting-star is one of our prettiest spring flowers,
which arrives a little before the baby-eyes and just as the brakes
are unrolling their green crosiers. There is something particularly
pleasing in these blossoms. It seems as though Nature
had taxed her ingenuity to produce something original when
she fashioned them. The name <i>Dodecatheon</i>, from the Greek,
is entirely a fanciful one, and means "the twelve gods."</p>

<p>Formerly <i>D. Meadia</i>, L., was considered the only species,
embracing many widely varying forms; but of late botanists
have made several of the forms into separate species.</p>

<p><i>D. Hendersoni</i> (Gray), Ktz., is the species prevalent in our
central and northern Coast Ranges. This has ovoid or obovoid,
very obtuse, entire leaves, with broad petiole, equaling
the blade, two inches long. Its flower-stem is from eight to
twelve inches high, bearing a cluster of bright rose-purple
flowers. The corolla has a short, dark-maroon tube, encircled
by a band of yellow, sometimes merging into white. A variety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[ 206]</a></span>
of this with very slender stems and the flower parts in fours is
common in the Bay region, and southward possibly to Santa
Barbara. This is called <i>var. cruciata</i>. Its blossoms have a
strong odor, suggestive of a tannery. In this species the capsule
opens at the top, splitting into a number of little teeth,
which soon turn downward.</p>

<div class="image" id="f070"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f070.png">SHOOTING-STARS&mdash;<i>Dodecatheon Hendersoni var. cruciata</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>D. Clevelandi</i>, Greene, is a beautiful species found in the
south. It sends up a tall shaft, crowned with a large cluster
of beautiful blossoms, varying from a delicate lilac to pure
white. The petals are ringed below with pale yellow, and the
beak of the flower is a rich prune-purple. There is a certain
generous, fine look about these flowers, although they are
exquisitely delicate. Their charm is completed by a delicious
perfume, like that of the cultivated cyclamen.</p>

<p>Among the children the various forms are known by a number
of names, such as "mad violets," "prairie-pointers,"
"mosquito-bills," and "roosters'-heads." The latter is said to
be the designation of prosaic little boys who see in these blossoms
gaming possibilities, and who love to hook them together
and pull to see which head will come off first.</p>


<h3>PRICKLY PHLOX.</h3>

<h4><i>Gilia Californica</i>, Benth. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Woody; two or three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Palmately
three- to seven-parted, with spreading, needle-like divisions, two to four
lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary, at the ends of the branchlets; rose-pink
or lilac, with a white eye. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla-limb.</i>&mdash;An
inch and a half across. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry hills from Monterey
to San Bernardino.</p></blockquote>

<p>I hardly know how to describe these delightful flowers. At
a little distance the plant-stems have almost the look of a cactus,
so densely are they clothed with the small, rigid leaves.
Nor does a closer acquaintance serve to lessen the likeness&mdash;for
in our breathless haste to take possession of the beautiful
blossoms we are quite certain to have their prickly character
impressed upon the hands as well as upon the sight. The texture
of the flowers is of the finest silk, with an exquisite sheen;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[ 208]</a></span>
and they have a delicate fragrance. Growing at the tips of the
numerous branchlets, they often form large masses of rich rose-colored
bloom, which are especially brilliant and showy against
the warm foliage.</p>

<div class="image" id="f071"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f071.png">PRICKLY PHLOX&mdash;<i>Gilia Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>In some localities they are called "rock-rose," an unfortunate
name in two respects: it has long belonged to a yellow
flower of an entirely different family&mdash;<i>Helianthemum</i>; and
these blossoms do not in the least resemble a rose.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN FOUR-O'CLOCK.</h3>

<h4><i>Mirabilis Californica</i>, Gray. Four-o'clock Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;From a woody base; a foot or two long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate;
six to fifteen lines long; rather thick. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Magenta-colored;
one to three in a campanulate, calyx-like, five-toothed involucre. Involucres
nearly sessile. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Six lines long; open funnel-form;
five-lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. Anthers yellow. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Globose;
one-celled. Style filiform. Stigma capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Southern California
and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the heat of the day is over and the morning-glories
are folding together their faded chalices, the bright little four-o'clocks
begin to open their myriad magenta-colored eyes upon
the closing day, and they, together with the evening primroses,
will keep the vigils of the night. These diaphanous little
flowers, with their long stamens resting on the lower side of
the perianth, are like diminutive azaleas.</p>

<p>They are very puzzling, and the part that baffles the young
botanist is the calyx, which, as it sometimes has two or three
corollas within it, cannot be considered a calyx at all, but must
be called an involucre. In reality the corolla is absent, and the
calyx, which is colored like a corolla, is called a perianth. This
appears to sit upon the top of the round ovary, but in reality a
green continuation of it is drawn down tightly over the ovary.</p>

<h3>BEACH MORNING-GLORY.</h3>

<h4><i>Convolvulus Soldanella</i>, L. Morning-glory Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or less long; trailing. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Kidney-shaped;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[ 210]</a></span>
long-petioled; leathery; an inch or two broad. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink to
lavender; one to nearly three inches across, with a pair of thin bracts
just below the calyx, partly enveloping it. (Otherwise as <i>C. luteolus</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The seashore from Puget Sound to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>The beach morning-glory trails its stems over the shifting
sands of the seashore, making clusters of beautiful foliage, over
which the large, delicate flowers raise their exquisite satin
funnels.</p>


<h3>CALYPSO.</h3>

<h4><i>Calypso borealis</i>, Salisb. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulb.</i>&mdash;Small; solid. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Three to six inches high. <i>Leaf.</i>&mdash;An
inch or two long. <i>Sepals</i> and petals light to deep rose-color; six to
nine lines long. <i>Lip.</i>&mdash;Brownish pink, mottled with purple. <i>Style.</i>&mdash;Petaloid,
oval, and concave, bearing the hemispherical anther on its
summit underneath. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The northern Coast Ranges; also across
the continent.</p></blockquote>

<p>It has never been my good fortune to find this rare and exquisite
little orchid, but beautiful specimens have been sent
from the redwoods of Sonoma County and from Oregon. The
books speak of it as growing in bogs; but I am told by those
who gathered them that the little plants sit lightly upon the
layer of needles that carpet the forest-floor. The roots scarcely
penetrate the soil, so that the plants are easily disengaged without
digging.</p>

<p>Nature produced a perfect work when she fashioned this
little plant, so simple, so charming in every way, with its one
dainty leaf and one unique blossom. The form of the column
is peculiarly interesting, being that of a curving concave petal,
bearing the anther, in the shape of a hollow hemisphere, on
its upper edge.</p>

<h3>WILD PORTULACA.</h3>

<h4><i>Calandrinia caulescens</i>, HBK.; <i>var. Menziesii</i>, Gray. Purslane Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Decumbent, branching herbs, mostly smooth. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[ 212]</a></span>
linear to oblanceolate; one to three inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In loose
racemes; rose-color or magenta; about an inch across. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Two;
keeled. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Mostly five. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four to eleven. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style slender. Stigma three-cleft. Seeds black, shining,
lens-shaped. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Lower California to Vancouver Island.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild portulaca is very abundant, and in seasons favorable
to its development is a very noticeable little plant. Its
succulent stems have a spreading habit and bear many satiny
flowers of a deep purplish-pink, which open in the bright sunshine.
The petals, which are veined with a slightly darker
color, become white toward the center, and the little anthers
are full of orange-colored pollen. These blossoms have a delicate,
somewhat musky perfume.</p>

<p>Cattle are fond of the herbage, and the plants are considered
excellent as potherbs and for salads. The seeds, which are a
favorite food of the wild dove are very pretty, being lens-shaped,
black and shining, with a granular surface.</p>


<h3>THE PRIDE OF CALIFORNIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Lathyrus splendens</i>, Kell. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Climbing; six to ten feet. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;About eight; scattered;
very variable; linear to lanceolate or oblong; acute; mucronate; strongly
three- to five-nerved. <i>Tendrils.</i>&mdash;Two- to five-parted. <i>Stipules.</i>&mdash;Small;
semi-sagittate. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Stout; usually seven- to ten-flowered.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Very large; brilliant crimson. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed;
eighteen-nerved. <i>Standard</i> and keel an inch or more long. <i>Pods.</i>&mdash;Three
inches long; smooth; compressed; ten- to twenty-seeded. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Parts
of San Diego County, and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Clambering over our wild shrubs, this wonderful pea gives
them the appearance of being loaded with a magnificence
of bloom quite unwonted. The blossoms are the richest and
most gorgeous of crimsons throughout, and have such a
superb air that it is difficult to believe they are not the product
of centuries of careful selection by the gardener. The long
standard turns back over the stem, continuing the gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[ 214]</a></span>
outlined keel in a long compound curve. The blossoms hang
from the stem in charming abandon, like a flock of graceful
tropic-birds poising upon the wing before taking flight, or like
a fleet of gayly decked pleasure-barges, with canopies thrown
back, fit for the conveyance of a Cleopatra.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN WILD CURRANT. INCENSE-SHRUB.</h3>

<h4><i>Ribes glutinosum</i>, Benth. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs six to fifteen feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Three- to five-lobed; glutinous
when young; three to five inches broad. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rose-pink
to pale pink; in long drooping racemes. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Petaloid; five-lobed.
<i>Petals</i> and stamens five on the calyx. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Styles
two; more or less united. <i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Blue, with a dense bloom; glandular-hispid.
<i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Ribes sanguineum</i>, Pursh. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast
Ranges; more common southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early winter in the south, and somewhat later northward,
the wild currant becomes a thing of beauty hardly to have
been expected. The young foliage, of a clear brilliant green,
is gayly decked with the long clusters of peculiarly fresh pink
blossoms, which seem like the very incarnation of the spirit of
Spring, producing a certain <i>eblouissement</i>, which quickens our
sense into an anticipation of beauty on every side.</p>

<p>We are made aware of a strong, heavy fragrance emanating
from this shrub, for which its numerous glands are
responsible, and which has gained for it the popular name of
"incense-shrub" in some localities.</p>

<p>The fruit, which ripens toward fall, is dry and bitter, or
insipid.</p>

<p>The genus <i>Ribes</i> includes the currant and the gooseberry,
and furnishes us with several charming shrubs in California.</p>

to twelve lines across; fringed. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Santa
Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>In March our southern meadows and hill-slopes are all
aglow with the lovely flowers of this charming little <i>Gilia</i>.
The plants are tiny, often no more than an inch high, but are
ambitious out of all proportion to their size, covering themselves
with blossoms exquisitely delicate in texture, form, and
coloring, which literally carpet the earth with an overlapping
mosaic.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful thought that upon every one of these
countless millions of little flowers that clothe the fields Nature
has bestowed such care that each is a masterpiece in itself.</p>


<h3>COMMON FLEABANE.</h3>

a loose corymb. <i>Disks.</i>&mdash;Yellow; three or four lines across.
<i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Innumerable; very narrow; flesh-color to rose-purple; about
three lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed on the Pacific and Atlantic
Coasts.</p></blockquote>

<p>The feathery, daisy-like flowers of the common fleabane
are of frequent occurrence in moist meadows or along the roadsides
in spring. The ray-flowers are so narrow as to form a
delicate fringe around the disk.</p>

<p>The common name arose from the belief that these plants
were harmful to fleas.</p>

<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Styles three. Stigmas capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
Monterey to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>In late spring the dry, open hills of the south are overrun
with the soft lavender of the <i>Chorizanthe</i>. The flowers are
small, but the whole plant is purplish, and the stems are quite
as productive of color as the blossoms. In fact, the whole
plant seems to consist of a scraggly interlacement of slender
branches and small flowers, as the leaves, which nestle close to
the ground, are not very noticeable.</p>

anthers spirally twisted after shedding the pollen. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style slender. Stigmas two. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Plumas County
southward; more abundant southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Just as our attention has been called afresh to the fields by
the sudden appearance of the "golden stars," or <i>Bloomeria</i>,
in late spring, we find, as we stoop to gather them, a charming
pink flower nestling close to the earth amid the grasses.
Though low of stature, these firstlings of the season atone for
it by brilliancy of color, and their pink blossoms have a peculiarly
clean, fresh, wide-awake appearance, reminding one of a
rosy-faced country wench.</p>

<p>While enjoying their bright beauty, we do not for a moment
suspect that we are paying homage to the famous "canchalagua"
of the Spanish-Californians. No well-regulated
household among these people is without bundles of these
herbs strung upon the rafters&mdash;for they are considered by them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[ 220]</a></span>
an indispensable remedy for fevers; also, an excellent bitter

<h3>FALSE MALLOW.</h3>

<h4><i>Malvastrum Thurberi</i>, Gray. Mallow Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby at base; three to fifteen feet high; densely tomentose.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;An inch or two across; thick. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Clustered in the
axils of the leaves; or in an interrupted naked spike. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-lobed;
with one to three bractlets. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five, about six lines long;
rose-purple. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;United in a column. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Numerous;
united in a ring. Styles united at base. Stigmas capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
southern Coast Ranges and islands of the Coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the mesas of the south we often see a shrubby member
of the mallow family, with long, wandlike branches ornamented
with closely set, pink flowers, of delicate texture and
pleasant perfume. This is the false mallow. It is a very handsome
and noticeable shrub when in full bloom. The anthers
are golden brown, and the stigmas are spherical instead of filiform.
Upon the seashore it blooms much earlier than in the
valleys inland.</p>


<h3>MESEMBRYANTHEMUM. FIG-MARIGOLD.</h3>

<h4><i>Mesembryanthemum æquilaterale</i>, Haworth. Fig-marigold Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Succulent plants. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Elongating; forming large mats. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
sessile; fleshy; three-angled; two inches or more long;
oblong. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Terminal; solitary; fifteen lines to two inches
across; pink. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With top-shaped tube and five-lobed border.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Very numerous; linear. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Innumerable. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-
to twenty-celled. Stigmas six to ten. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from
Point Reyes southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fig-marigold is a very common plant upon our seashore.
It seems to flourish best toward the south, where it
covers large tracts of sand with its succulent foliage, making
mats of pleasant verdure in otherwise sandy wastes. Its stems
often trail many yards down the cliffs, making beautiful natural
draperies, decked with myriads of the pink blossoms.
Because it is capable of withstanding the drouth in the most
remarkable manner, it has been planted to produce verdure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[ 222]</a></span>
where irrigation is impossible. The very numerous slender
petals give the flower the appearance at first sight of a <i>Composita</i>.
The fruit is pulpy and full of very small seeds, like
the fig, and has a suggestion of the flavor of the Isabella grape.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f078.png">FALSE MALLOW&mdash;<i>Malvastrum Thurberi</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Many species of <i>Mesembryanthemum</i> are cultivated in our
gardens, mostly as border-plants. The genus is a large one,
most of the species being native of Southern Africa, and it is
supposed that the three species now common upon our Coast
were introduced in the remote past without the agency of man.</p>

<h4><i>Gilia androsacea</i>, Steud. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to twelve inches high; erect; spreading. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
sessile; palmately five- to seven-parted; seemingly whorled.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In terminal clusters. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Salver-shaped; rose-pink,
lilac, or white, with a yellow or dark throat; its tube filiform, about an
inch long; limb eight to ten lines across. Filaments and style slender;
exserted. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the western part of the
State; into the Sierra foothills.</p></blockquote>

<p>The delicate flowers of this little plant may be found nestling
amid the grasses of dry hill-slopes in late spring, often
making charming bits of color. It is usually rather a low
plant, but in specially favorable situations it rises to a foot in
height. Its fragile flowers vary from pure white to lilac and a
lovely rose-pink, and look like small phloxes.</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4><i>Mimulus Douglasii</i>, Gray. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Flowering at half an inch high; later becoming a span high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate
or oblong; three- to five-nerved at base; narrowed into a
short petiole. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rich maroon, with deeper color in the throat
and some yellow below. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;An inch
to eighteen lines long; with dilated throat. Lower lip much shorter
than the ample, erect, upper one; sometimes almost wanting. (See
<i>Mimulus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>This little <i>Mimulus</i> is quite common upon gravelly or
stony hills. Its pert little maroon flowers, with their very
long tubes and erect lobes, so ridiculously out of proportion
to the size of the tiny plant, give it the look of some very
important small personage.</p>

<h3>BITTER-ROOT. SPAT'LUM. TOBACCO-ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Lewisia rediviva</i>, Pursh. Purslane Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;Very thick. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Clustered; linear-oblong; one or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[ 224]</a></span>
inches long. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;One-flowered; one or two inches long; jointed
in the middle, with a whorl of five to seven scarious bracts at the joint.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Six to eight; six to nine lines long; scarious-margined. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Twelve
to fifteen; rose-color, sometimes white; oblong; eight to sixteen
lines long; rotately spreading in sunshine. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Forty or
more. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style three- to eight-parted nearly to the
base. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The mountains of California, northward and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Within our borders this little plant is not abundant, but
must be sought upon mountain heights. Formerly it was supposed
not to occur south of Mt. Diablo, but it has since been
found in the mountains of the southern part of the State and
at intermediate points. It is very abundant in Montana, where
it has been adopted as the State flower.</p>

<p>The plants are very small, being but an inch or two high,
but the flowers are handsome and showy, and the delicate,
rose-colored corollas, which are often two inches across, are of
an exquisite silken texture. The root is remarkably large and
thick for so small a plant, and it contains a nutritious, farinaceous
matter, much esteemed by the Indians for food. Among
them it is known as "spat'lum," and they gather large quantities
of it, which they store in bags for future use.</p>

<p>This was the "racine-amère," or "bitter-root," of the
early French settlers. It is also known as "tobacco-root,"
because when boiled it has a tobacco-like odor.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i>rediviva</i>, was bestowed because of the
wonderful vitality of these plants. It is known upon good
authority that specimens which had been drying for two years
in an herbarium continued to produce leaves, and at last, when
taken out and planted, went on growing and blossomed!</p>

<p>This genus is an exception to the other members of the
Purslane family, in having more than two sepals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[ 225]</a></span></p>


<h3>SPINELESS TUNA.</h3>

<h4><i>Opuntia basilaris, var. ramosa</i>, Parish. Cactus Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Low; spreading; branching freely above. <i>Joints.</i>&mdash;Flat; smooth;
without large spines, but with close tufts of minute bristles; obovate or
fan-shaped; five to eight inches long; nearly as wide at the top. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Large;
brilliant rose-magenta; two or three inches long. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Dry;
sub-globose. (Flower-structure as in <i>O. Engelmanni</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
southern deserts and San Bernardino Mountains.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the arid regions of the southern interior, this <i>Opuntia</i> is
a very common one, and its large, brilliant rose-magenta
flowers attract the attention wherever seen. They are very
tempting blossoms, and it is hard to resist them, even though
we know the penalty will be the conversion of thumbs and
fingers into pin-cushions for innumerable, minute, tormenting
thorns.</p>


<h3>SNOW-BERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Symphoricarpos racemosus</i>, Michx. Honeysuckle Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to four feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; short-petioled;
cuneate to oblong; entire or lobed; nine to eighteen lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small;
mostly in terminal clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Adnate to the ovary;
with five-toothed border. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five-lobed; three
lines long; waxen; pinkish; very hairy within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; on
the corolla. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-celled. <i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Waxen-white; six lines
in diameter. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early winter the pure-white clusters of the snow-berry,
on their almost leafless stems, make flecks of light through
the dun woods. At this season of few woodland attractions,
these berries, together with the trailing sprays of the fragrant
yerba buena and the long graceful leaves of the iris, are about
the only trophies to be obtained upon a walk. In early spring,
when their slender twigs first begin to leaf out, these little
shrubs are among the most delicate and airy of growing things,
and make a tender veil of green through the shadowy woodland.
The blossoms, which arrive rather late, are inconspicuous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[ 226]</a></span></p>


<h3>TREE-MALLOW.</h3>

<h4><i>Lavatera assurgentiflora</i>, Kell. Mallow Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Shrubs.</i>&mdash;Six to fifteen feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Three to nine inches
across. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink, veined with maroon. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft,
with an involucel below, like a second calyx. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Twelve to
eighteen lines long. <i>Filaments.</i>&mdash;Numerous; united in a column.
<i>Styles.</i>&mdash;Numerous; filiform. <i>Carpels.</i>&mdash;One-seeded, in a ring around
an axis; separating at maturity. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The islands off the Coast;
cultivated on the mainland north to Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>


<p>The <i>Lavateras</i> are Old-World plants, with the exception
of a few species which are natives of the islands of our southern
coast. In the early days the Padres planted the above species
(<i>L. assurgentiflora</i>) plentifully around the old Missions, and
thence it has spread and become spontaneous in many localities.
It can be seen in San Francisco, planted as wind-break
hedges about the market-gardens, where it thrives luxuriantly
as long as it is protected from cattle.</p>

<p>The leaves and twigs abound in mucilage, and are very
fattening and nutritious food for sheep and cattle, who are very
fond of it.</p>


<h3>WILD HONEYSUCKLE.</h3>

<h4><i>Lonicera hispidula</i>, Dougl. Honeysuckle Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Woody; climbing and twining. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; short-petioled;
oval; pale; one to three inches long; the upper pairs uniting around
the stem. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink; in spikes of several whorls. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Minute;
growing to the ovary; border five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular;
six lines to an inch long; bilabiate; the lips strongly revolute; the
upper four-lobed, the lower entire. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; much exserted.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two- or three-celled. Style slender. Stigma capitate. <i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Scarlet;
translucent. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early summer the climbing honeysuckle with its pale
foliage flings its long arms over neighboring trees and shrubs,
showing glimpses here and there of small pinkish flowers. But
it is far more noticeable in the fall, when its long pendulous
branches are laden with the fine clusters of translucent, orange-red
berries. It is quite variable and has many forms, which
are all considered varieties of the one species.</p>

<h3>PINK PAINT-BRUSH. ESCOBITA.</h3>

<h4><i>Orthocarpus purpurascens</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six to twelve inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Variously parted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[ 228]</a></span>
filiform divisions. <i>Bracts.</i>&mdash;About equaling the flowers; tipped with
crimson or pale pink. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;About an inch long; the lower lip
only moderately inflated and three-saccate; the upper long, hooked,
bearded, crimson. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Large. (See <i>Orthocarpus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely
distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bright-magenta tufts of the pink paint-brush are often
so abundant that they give the country a purplish hue for miles
at a stretch. The Spanish-Californians have a pretty name for
these blossoms, calling them "escobitas," meaning "little
whisk-brooms."</p>

<p><i>O. densiflorus</i>, Benth., is a very similar species; but its
corolla has a straight upper lip, without hairs.</p>


<h3>CLARKIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Clarkia elegans</i>, Dougl. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to six feet high; simple or branching. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
broadly ovate to linear; dentate; an inch or more long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;About
nine lines long; with long, slender claws and rhomboidal
blades; pink. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight; all perfect. Filaments with a hairy
scale at base. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Four-lobed. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Six to nine lines long;
sessile. (Otherwise as <i>C. concinna</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>This plant is a very common one along our dusty roadsides
in early summer, and it shows a facility in adapting itself to
quite a range of climate and condition. It grows from six
inches to six feet high, is nearly smooth or quite hairy, and
has rather large flowers or quite small ones. Its scarlet stamens,
purple-pink petals, and often deeper purple sepals make an odd
combination of color. It often grows in showy masses, making
patches of glowing color under the shade of trees.</p>

<blockquote><p>Evergreen, much branched, spiny shrubs, four to seven feet high.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[ 230]</a></span>
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;With from one to three leaflets. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Three to nine
lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Magenta-colored; solitary; sessile; seven to
nine lines long; papilionaceous. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;All ten distinct. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;One-celled;
two inches long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from Lake
County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon wild mountain-slopes where are heard the fluting
notes of a certain shy bird that rarely comes near habitations,
the chaparral pea often makes dense, impenetrable thickets.
It would be impossible to mistake it for any other shrub, with
its solitary magenta-colored pea-blossoms, which often cover
the bushes with a mass of color. Its green branchlets terminate
in long, rigid spines, which are often clothed with small leaves
nearly to the end.</p>

<p>Woe to him who tries to penetrate the chaparral when it is
composed of this formidable and uncompromising shrub! The
result is quite likely to be a humiliating progress upon hands
and knees before he can extricate himself, probably with torn
garments and scratched visage.</p>


<h3>HEDGE-NETTLE.</h3>

<h4><i>Stachys bullata</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Rough, pubescent herbs. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Ten to eighteen inches high;
four- angled. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; ovate or ovate-oblong; cordate;
coarsely crenate; wrinkly veined; petioled; an inch or two long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pinkish; in a narrow, interrupted spike. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Eight lines long; bilabiate. Upper lip erect; lower
deflexed, of three unequal lobes, spotted with purple. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four.
Filaments hairy. Anthers divergently two-celled. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four
seedlike nutlets. Style filiform. Stigma two-cleft. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The hedge-nettles are common weeds, of which we have
several species. <i>S. bullata</i>, so called on account of its leaves,
which look as though blistered, is the most widespread. It is
quite variable in aspect, and we are constantly meeting it in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[ 232]</a></span>
new guises and being deceived into believing it something finer
than it really is, through some subtle change in its usually
homely little pink flowers.</p>

<h3>TWINING HYACINTH.</h3>

<h4><i>Brodiæa volubilis</i>, Baker. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Coated corm about one inch in diameter. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical;
broadly linear; a foot or more long. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Twining; two to even
twelve feet long; naked. <i>Umbel.</i>&mdash;Many-flowered. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Five
to eight lines long; rose-color without, whitish within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three;
alternating with three notched staminodia. Filaments winged;
very short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style short. Stigma capitate.
<i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Stropholirion Californicum</i>, Torr. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Sierra foothills, from
Mariposa County northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this plant we see the <i>Brodiæa</i> disporting itself in a very
odd manner, having vinelike aspirations. It produces several
long leaves, which lie prostrate upon the ground, and then the
stem puts in its appearance and commences a wonderful series
of evolutions not to be outdone by any contortionist. It twists
and clambers and climbs, reaching a height of five or six feet,
often having expended twice that amount of stem in its convolutions.</p>

<p>During this remarkable process, which consumes from two
to four weeks, the terminal bud has remained dormant. But
it now commences to grow, and in a couple of weeks the
flower-cluster is complete in all its beauty. It is sometimes six
inches across.</p>

<p>It often happens that before the flower has blossomed, the
stem is broken off at the ground. Strangely enough, this
seems not to matter at all, for it grows on and perfects its
flowers just as though nothing had occurred. People often
bring the stem indoors and allow it to climb up over the curtains,
where they can watch the interesting process of its
growth.</p>

inches or so across; slightly irregular; with wavy, margined lobes; the
upper spotted within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;About equaling the corolla. Style
crimson. Stigma funnel-form. (Otherwise as <i>R. occidentale</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
British Columbia to Marin County.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our northern counties the rugged mountain-sides are
often densely covered with the lovely rose-bay, which in early
summer presents an appearance it would be impossible to rival.
When the foliage, which is very rich in both quality and hue,
is thickly massed with the great glowing flower-clusters, the
sight is worth a pilgrimage to see. It is a shrub so beautiful,
we marvel it is not generally cultivated in gardens.</p>

<p>The bees are very fond of the blossoms, but popular tradition
ascribes a poisonous quality to the honey made from them.</p>

<p>We have noticed no perfume in these flowers, but the
leaves are often quite pleasantly fragrant.</p>


<h3>COMMON WILD ROSE.</h3>

<h4><i>Rosa Californica</i>, Cham. and Schlecht. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Erect shrubs three to eight feet high. Prickles few; stout; recurved;
mostly in pairs beneath the entire stipules. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; pinnate;
with five to seven leaflets. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Ovate or oblong; serrate.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Few to many in clusters; pale-pink. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With urn-shaped
tube and five-cleft border, whose lobes are foliaceously tipped.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; six to nine lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Very numerous.
<i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Several; bony; in, but free from, the calyx-tube. <i>Hips.</i>&mdash;Many;
four or five lines through. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Diego to Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild rose is one of the few flowers that blooms cheerfully
through the long summer days, lavishing its beautiful
clusters of deliciously fragrant flowers as freely along the dusty
roadside as in the more secluded thicket. In autumn it often
seems inspired to a special luxuriance of blossoming, and it
lingers to greet the asters and mingle its pink flowers and
brilliant scarlet hips with their delicate lilacs.</p>

<p><i>R. gymnocarpa</i>, Nutt., "the redwood-rose," is exquisitely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[ 236]</a></span>
dainty. This is found in shady places under the trees. It
blooms earlier than the common species, and is neither so
abundant nor so fragrant. Its flowers are barely an inch
across and of a bright pink. The prickles are straight, and
the calyx-lobes are without leafy tips, while the leaflets are
small and shapely.</p>

concinnum</i>, Fisch. and Mey. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from Santa
Barbara to Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>

<p>In June these charming blossoms may be found in the company
of the maidenhair fern fringing the banks of shady roads,
or standing in glowing masses under the buckeye-trees. In
them nature has ventured upon one of those rather daring
color combinations of which we would have hardly dreamed,
and the result is delightful. The petals are bright rose-pink,
while the sepals are of a red pink.</p>


<h3>SPREADING DOGBANE.</h3>

</div>

<p>The small pink flowers of the spreading dogbane may be
found all through the summer, often upon our driest hillsides.
The shapely little blossoms are of a flesh-tint without, richly
veined with deeper pink within, and quite fragrant. The plants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[ 238]</a></span>
have a milky juice and a tough fiber in the stem, similar to
that in the American-Indian hemp. The plant was formerly
supposed to be poisonous to dogs, from which fact it received
its generic name, which translated gives the common English
name, "dogbane." It is used in medicine as a remedy for
rheumatic gout. The very long pods seem absurdly out of
proportion to the small flowers.</p>

<p><i>A. cannabinum</i>, L., the American-Indian hemp, is also found
within our borders, but it grows along stream-banks and in
marshy places. It has oblong, pointed leaves, and small
greenish-white flowers, only two lines long, whose close cylindrical
corollas hardly surpass the calyx. The yellowish-brown
bark of this plant is very tough and fibrous, and at the same
time soft and silky. Our Indians have always found it of the
utmost value in the making of ropes, lariats, nets, mats, baskets,
etc., and before the coming of the white man they even made
certain articles of clothing of it. A tincture made from the
root is a recognized drug in the pharmacop&#339;ia. Professor
Thouin, of Paris, says that a permanent dye may be obtained
from a decoction of it, which is brown or black, according to
the mordant used.</p>


<h3>FIRECRACKER FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Brodiæa coccinea</i>, Gray. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Grasslike, a foot or two long. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;One to three feet
high; six- to fifteen-flowered. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;An inch or two long; rich
crimson; the limb of six green or yellowish oblong lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three;
on the perianth. Filaments adnate to its tube. Anther tips
exserted. <i>Staminodia.</i>&mdash;Three; broad; short; white; on the throat of
the perianth, alternating with the stamens. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style exserted. Stigma three-lobed. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Brevoortia coccinea</i>, Wats.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The mountains from Mendocino County to Shasta County.</p></blockquote>

<p>When our northern valleys have become parched by the
first heat of summer, many beautiful flowers are still to be
found in deep cañon retreats, where the streams, overarched
by great shadowing oaks, gush downward through leafy copses
of hazelwood and thimble-berry by beds of moss and fern.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[ 240]</a></span>
Upon the walls of such charming gorges the firecracker flower
rears its slender stem and shakes out its bunch of brilliant crimson
blossoms. These are a prophetic symbol of our national
holiday rather than an aid to its celebration&mdash;for they have
often passed away before the Fourth of July.</p>

<h3>GODETIA. FAREWELL TO SPRING.</h3>

<h4><i>Godetia viminea</i>, Spach. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high; sometimes stout. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear
to linear-lanceolate; entire; an inch or two long; distant. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Nodding
in the bud. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Two to four lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Deep
rose-color, sometimes yellowish at base with a dark spot; nine
to fifteen lines long. <i>Capsules.</i>&mdash;Smoothish; eight to eighteen lines
long; its sides two-ribbed; sessile or short-pediceled. (See <i>Godetia</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From the Columbia River southward to Ventura.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early summer the rosy flowers of this <i>Godetia</i> make
bright masses of color along dry banks and hill-slopes. Its
blossoms are very variable as to marking. Sometimes the
petals have a bright crimson blotch at the base and sometimes
they are without it, both forms often occurring upon the same
plant. In some seasons all the flowers are without the blotch.</p>

<p><i>G. grandiflora</i>, Lindl., found in Humboldt and Mendocino
Counties, is probably the most showy species we have. The
plants are a foot or two high and covered all over with the
wonderful flowers, which are often four inches across. These
are delicate pink, blotched with rich crimson.</p>

<p><i>G. Bottæ</i>, Spach., is an exquisite species found in the Coast
Ranges, from Monterey to San Diego. Its very slender stems
lift the fragile, satiny cups above the dried grasses in charming
companies. These blossoms also vary much. Among the
prettiest forms is one which is pale rose or lilac, blending to
white at the center, delicately striate with purple-dotted lines,
and having a rich purple spot in the center. This often grows
with the lilac butterfly-tulip, <i>Calochortus splendens</i>, and at a
little distance is so similar, it is difficult to distinguish it from the
lily. But the lily rarely or never grows in throngs. The capsules
of this species have pedicels from three to nine lines long.</p>

<h3>BLEEDING-HEART.</h3>

<h4><i>Dicentra formosa</i>, DC. Bleeding-heart Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ternately dissected, with toothed leaflets. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[ 242]</a></span>
inches to two feet high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rose-colored to pale pink, sometimes
almost white or yellowish; nodding. (Floral structure as in <i>D.
chrysantha</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges and Sierras, from Middle
California to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bleeding-heart is a rather shy flower, and never makes
itself common enough to dull our enthusiasm for it. It fully
merits its specific name, for it is a plant of elegant form
throughout, from its shapely divided leaves to its graceful clusters
of pendent hearts. It is found in the woods of our Coast
Ranges, but may be seen to best advantage when nestling amid
the lush grasses of Sierra meadows.</p>


<h3>INDIAN RHUBARB. UMBRELLA-PLANT.</h3>

<h4><i>Saxifraga peltata</i>, Torr. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Thick; creeping. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical; long-petioled; a
foot or more across when mature; nine- to fourteen-lobed; centrally
depressed. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-lobed.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; roundish; three lines or more long; purplish-pink. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten.
<i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Two; distinct. Stigmas capitate or reniform.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras, from Mariposa County to Mt. Shasta; also Mendocino
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the borders of our swift-flowing mountain streams,
where the water-ouzel flies up and down all day, sometimes
filling the air with melody as he passes, may be seen the large
lotus-like leaves of this great Saxifrage. They stand with their
dark, warm stems in the water; or, poising upon the brink,
they lean gracefully over it, making myriad reflections in the
brown depths below, while every passing breeze awakens a
quick response among them.</p>

<p>Early in the season, before the coming of the leaves, these
plants send up tall stems with dense, branching clusters of
handsome purplish-pink flowers. The leaves, small at first,
continue to grow until late summer, when they have reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[ 244]</a></span>
their perfection; after which they begin to deepen into the
richest of autumn hues.</p>

<div class="image" id="f089"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f089.png">BLEEDING-HEART&mdash;<i>Dicentra formosa</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This plant is commonly called "Indian rhubarb," because
the Indians are extravagantly fond of the stalks of the leaves
and flowers. It is now cultivated in Eastern gardens.</p>


<h3>GREAT WILLOW-HERB. FIREWEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Epilobium spicatum</i>, Lam. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Often four to seven feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Scattered; willow-like.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purplish-pink; an inch or more across. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Linear;
limb four-parted; often colored. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight. Anthers
purplish. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-celled. Seeds silky-tufted. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>E. angustifolium</i>,
L. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras; eastward to the Atlantic; also in
the North Coast mountains. Found also in Europe and Asia.</p></blockquote>

<p>This plant has received one of its English names, because
its leaves are like those of the willow and its seeds are furnished
with silken down, like the fluff on the willow.</p>

<p>It is our finest and most showy species of <i>Epilobium</i>, and is
also found in the Eastern States, where it is still known by a
former name&mdash;<i>E. angustifolium</i>, L. Owing to the fact that
it grows with special luxuriance in spots which have been
recently burned over, it is commonly known as "fireweed."
It may be found in perfection in the Sierras in August, where
its great spikes of large pink flowers make showy masses of
color along the streams and through the meadows, commanding
our warmest admiration.</p>

<p>In the fall the tall, pliant, widely branching stems of the
"autumn willow-herb"&mdash;<i>E. paniculatum</i>, Nutt.&mdash;stand everywhere
by the roadside. The small pink flowers, half an inch
across, terminate the almost leafless stems, and later are replaced
by the dry, curled remains of the opened capsules and
the feathery down of the escaping seeds.</p>

<h3>ALPINE HEATHER.</h3>

<h4><i>Bryanthus Breweri</i>, Gray. Heath Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Dwarf evergreens; six inches to a foot high; woody. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[ 246]</a></span>
linear; three to seven lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purplish-rose;
on glandular pedicels. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed; small. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Saucer-shaped;
six lines or so across. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Seven to ten.
Anthers two-celled; opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled. Style
slender. Stigma capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The High Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>This little plant, to which Mr. Muir fondly alludes in his
charming book, "The Mountains of California," may be found
blooming in July and August in the Sierras. Sometimes it
nestles in rocky crevices in the cool drip of the snow-banks,
and again it ventures boldly out into the openings, where it
spreads its rich carpet, covered with a wealth of rosy bloom.
From the abundance of this little heathling about its shores,
one of our mountain lakes has received the name of "Heather
Lake."</p>


<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<h4><i>Silene Gallica</i>, L. Pink Family.</h4>

<p>Hairy. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Generally several. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Spatulate; six to
eighteen lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In terminal, one-sided racemes;
four or five lines long; short-pediceled. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Pale rose-color or
almost white; barely exceeding the calyx. (Flower-structure as in <i>S.
Californica</i>.)</p>

<p>This little weed has come to us from Europe, and it is now
so widely distributed, both near the sea and inland, that it is
hard to believe it is not native. The slender racemes are from
two to four inches long, and the little flowers vary from white
to pale pink. They can boast none of the showy beauty of
their relatives, the Indian pink and the Yerba del Indio.</p>

<h3>ALPINE PHLOX.</h3>

<h4><i>Phlox Douglasii</i>, Hook. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Plants forming cushion-like tufts; three or four inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Needle-like;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[ 248]</a></span>
six lines or less long; with shorter ones crowded in the
axils. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink, lilac, or white; sessile; terminating the branchlets.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Salver-form; with five-lobed border.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; on the tube of the corolla. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras, from Mariposa County
northward and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This delightful little flower may be found in the Sierras at
an altitude of from five to ten thousand feet. It loves the open
sunshine of the cool mountain heights, and with its cushiony
tufts clothes many a bit of granite soil with beauty. It seems
undaunted by its stern surroundings, and lifts its innocent eyes
confidingly to the skies which bend gently over it&mdash;those skies</p>

<h3>PINK MONKEY-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Mimulus Lewisii</i>, Pursh. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; eighteen inches or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Sessile;
oblong-ovate to lanceolate; denticulate; somewhat viscid. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Elongated.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Eighteen lines to two inches long; with tube
exceeding the calyx and five ample spreading ciliate lobes; rose-color
or paler, with usually a darker stripe down the center of each lobe.
Ridges of lower lobe yellow and spotted; bearded. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Included.
(See <i>Mimulus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras, from Central California
northward and eastward to Montana.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most beautiful of all our monkey-flowers is this
charming species, which is found along the cold streams of the
Sierras. Its large flowers have a fragile, delicate look, and the
light stems and leaves are of an exquisite green.</p>

<p>I remember coming upon a delightful company of these
blossoms, in a little emerald meadow upon the margin of one
of those alpine lakelets which nestle among the granite crags.
They seemed the most fitting flowers for just such a high, pure
atmosphere.</p>

of the branches. <i>Flower-stems.</i>&mdash;Several inches high. Umbel several-flowered.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Salver-shaped; an inch or
less across; deep rose-color, with a yellow eye. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;High on
the corolla-throat opposite its lobes. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style slender.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>If one takes his alpenstock in hand and climbs to the snow line
in late summer, he is apt to be rewarded by the charming
flowers of the Sierra primrose. The little plants grow in the
drip of the snow-banks, where the melting ice gradually liberates
the tufts of evergreen leaves. The glowing flowers look
as though they might have caught and held the last rosy reflection
of the sunset upon the snow above them.</p>


<h3>PRIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS.</h3>

<h4><i>Pentstemon Menziesii, var. Newberryi</i>, Gray. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to a foot high; woody at base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate,
obovate, or oblong; an inch or less long; leathery. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Usually
one-flowered, forming a short, glandular-pubescent raceme.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Bright rose-pink; an inch long. <i>Anthers.</i>&mdash;White-woolly;
with divergent cells. (See <i>Pentstemon</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The High Sierras of
Central California.</p></blockquote>

<p>This charming <i>Pentstemon</i> is one of the most gracious
flowers to be found in the Sierras in late summer. Upon
banks overhanging the streams, or growing at great heights
under the open sky, it makes many a rock-shelf gay with its
brilliant pink blossoms.</p>

<p>We wonder how it can possibly subsist upon the hard, glittering
granite; but there the mystery of its life continues from
day to day, and there it cheerfully produces its masses of
bright flowers, which gladden the weary climber to these
snowy heights.</p>

<p>This species of <i>Pentstemon</i> is well marked by its white-woolly
anthers, which almost fill the throat. Northward it
passes into the typical <i>P. Menziesii</i>, which has flowers from
violet-blue to pink-purple.</p>

<h3>LESSINGIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Lessingia leptoclada</i>, Gray. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Finely white-woolly. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;From a few inches to two feet high,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[ 252]</a></span>
with numerous, almost filiform branchlets, bearing few or solitary heads
of pink or white flowers. <i>Lower leaves.</i>&mdash;Spatulate; sparingly toothed;
withering early. <i>Upper leaves.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate, or linear and entire; sessile;
uppermost diminished into remote, subulate bracts. <i>Heads.</i>&mdash;Five- to
twenty-flowered. Of tubular disk-flowers only. Outer flowers
much larger. <i>Involucre.</i>&mdash;Silky hairy; broadly campanulate; with
imbricated, appressed bracts. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widespread.</p></blockquote>

<p>In late summer the pink <i>Lessingia</i> is apparent along dry
roadsides or embankments, where its blossoms make charming
masses of soft color. It is quite abundant in the Yosemite,
especially in the lower end of the valley.</p>

<p><i>L. Germanorum</i>, Cham., found plentifully from San Diego
to San Francisco, has yellow flowers.</p>


<h3>ELEPHANTS' HEADS.</h3>

<h4><i>Pedicularis Gr&#339;nlandica</i>, Retz. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Tall and slender; smooth. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; lanceolate
in outline; pinnately parted into linear-lanceolate, serrate divisions;
diminishing upward into the flower-bracts. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Pink; in a dense
spike several inches long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With
short tube and bilabiate limb. Upper lip with a long beak, like an elephant's
trunk; lower three-lobed, deflexed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four. Filaments
and style filiform; sheathed in the beak. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras from King's River northward; and eastward to
Hudson's Bay.</p></blockquote>

<p>No more curious flower could be found than this little denizen
of our alpine meadows. Its tall pink spikes attract one
from a distance, and astonish one upon nearer acquaintance by
the wonderful resemblance of their blossoms to many small
elephants' heads. The forehead, the long ears hanging at the
sides of the head, and the long, slender, curving trunk are all
perfectly simulated.</p>

<p>These flowers have a pleasant perfume.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>P. attollens</i>, Gray&mdash;often found growing
with the above, is similar to it in general structure, but its
leaves are more dissected, its flower-spike is rather woolly, and
its beak is only two or three lines long. These blossoms bear
no resemblance to the elephant.</p>

<h3>ALPINE WILLOW-HERB. ROCK-FRINGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Epilobium obcordatum</i>, Gray. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Decumbent; three to five inches long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[ 254]</a></span>
ovate; sessile; four to ten lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;One to five;
bright rose-pink; over an inch across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;With linear tube and
four-cleft limb. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; erect and spreading; obcordate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight;
four shorter. Filaments slender; exserted. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Linear,
four-celled. Style filiform; much exserted. Stigma four-lobed.
Seeds silky-tufted. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras from Tulare County northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though low of stature, this little willow-herb is a charming
plant, with large rosy flowers. At an elevation of eight thousand
feet or more in the mountains, it nestles amid the rocks,
fringing their crevices with a profusion of brilliant bloom.
Though it often costs a hard climb up rocky crags to secure it,
we feel well repaid by its bright beauty.</p>

<h4><i>Hosackia Purshiana</i>, Benth. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Soft-woolly throughout. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Erect or loosely spreading over
the ground. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Sessile. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;One to three; ovate to lanceolate;
three to nine lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Yellowish-pink; solitary;
two or three lines long. Peduncles usually exceeding the leaves; with
a single leaflet below the flower. <i>Calyx-teeth.</i>&mdash;Linear; much exceeding
the tube, about equaling the corolla. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Narrow; twelve to
eighteen lines long; five- to seven-seeded. (See <i>Hosackia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>This little plant is very abundant and widespread. It
makes its appearance after the drouth sets in, and often spreads
over the ground in considerable patches. Its woolly or silky
foliage has a pale cast, and its small, solitary, pinkish flowers,
which are quite numerous, are not unattractive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[ 255]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>Scoliopus Bigelovii</i>, Torr. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two; oval-elliptical to narrowly oblanceolate; four to fifteen
inches long; blotched with brown. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Three to twelve;
on lax pedicels three to nine inches long. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Whitish, veined
with purple; spreading. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Erect; narrowly linear; wine-color
without. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled; three-angled. Stigma
three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges from Marin to Humboldt
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the first white blossoms of the toothwort are making
their appearance in moist woodlands, we may be sure that the
fetid adder's-tongue is already pushing its shining green leaves
aboveground away up in the cold cañons of north hill-slopes;
and unless we hasten, we shall be too late to see its curious
flowers. I have often arrived only in time to find its fruit,
which resembles a beechnut in shape. When the flowers first
open they stand erect, held in the shining chalice formed by
the two sheathing green leaves. Later the leaves open out,
showing their beautiful blotched surfaces, and the three-angled
flower-stems become limp and twisted. The petals stand erect,
and are so slender as to resemble three linear stigmas. The
little oval anthers are green before opening, but soon become
golden with the discharging pollen.</p>

<p>These flowers are elegant in appearance, and suggestive
of orchids; but unfortunately they have a very offensive odor,
like that of the star-fishes found upon our beaches, which
makes us quite content to leave them ungathered. But the
large yellow slug has no such aversion to them, and we have
often seen him banqueting upon them. Indeed, he is so fond
of them that the flowers are often entirely gone from the stems.</p>

<h3>HOUND'S-TONGUE.</h3>

<h4><i>Cynoglossum grande</i>, Dougl. Borage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Two feet or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; long-petioled;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[ 258]</a></span>
ovate-oblong; pointed; usually rounded at base; often a foot long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright blue; in a terminal panicle. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply five-cleft.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Rotate; with short tube and five-lobed border; having
five beadlike crests in the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; on the corolla,
alternate with its lobes. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-lobed. Style undivided. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Four
prickly nutlets. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Marin County to Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>Among the first plants to respond to the quickening influence
of the early winter rains, is the hound's-tongue, whose
large, pointed leaves begin to push their way aboveground
usually in January. At first these are often quite velvety beneath
and of a pinkish hue, and hold hidden within their midst
the well-formed buds which a few warm, sunny days will call
forth. The flowers, at first pink, become bright blue after fertilization
has taken place.</p>

<p>The favorite haunts of this welcome blossom are half-shaded
woods, where it rears its tall stalk in almost sole possession at
this early season.</p>

<p>The common name is a translation of the generic name,
which is derived from two Greek words, signifying <i>dog</i> and
<i>tongue</i>, bestowed because of the shape of the leaves. In the
olden times a superstition was rife that if a person laid the
hound's-tongue beneath his feet it would prevent dogs from
barking at him.</p>

<p>The distribution of the seed is most cunningly provided for,
as the upper surfaces of the nutlets are covered with tiny
barbs, which a magnifying-glass reveals to be quite perfect
little anchors, admirably adapted for catching in the hair
of animals.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIA LILAC. SOAP-BUSH.</h3>

<h4><i>Ceanothus divaricatus</i>, Nutt. Buckthorn Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Tall, almost arborescent shrubs; with very divergent and rigid
branches. Twigs cylindrical; smooth; mostly very pale. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
short-petioled; ovate; four to ten lines long; three-nerved;
somewhat leathery. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In a narrowly oblong, dense cluster
two or three inches long; pale blue to white. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Two or three</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f096"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f096.png">HOUND'S-TONGUE&mdash;<i>Cynoglossum grande</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<blockquote><p>lines in diameter; not lobed; scarcely crested. (See <i>Ceanothus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[ 260]</a></span>
the southern Coast Range.</p></blockquote>

<p>This species of California lilac is very abundant in the south,
and is specially characterized by its widely branching habit
and its round, pale-green twigs. The flowers are usually light
blue; but in some localities they are pure white. Near Santa
Barbara, in January, the mountain-slopes are often snowy with
them.</p>

<p>Dr. Gregg, of San Diego, while hunting one day in Lower
California, just over the border, had his attention called to the
wild lilac by his old Mexican guide, who assured him that the
blossoms in themselves were excellent soap. Taking a handful
of them down to the stream, he rubbed them vigorously
between his wet hands, and found to his astonishment that they
made an excellent lather, with a pleasant fragrance of wintergreen.
I have since proved the fact for myself. A more
delightful way of performing one's ablutions can hardly be
imagined than at the brookside with so charming a soap. It
is very cleansing and leaves the skin pleasantly soft.</p>

<p>It was probably the blossoms of <i>C. integerrimus</i> he used, as
that shrub is called "soap-bush" in that region; but I have
since tried the experiment upon <i>C. divaricatus</i> and some other
species with perfect success, from which I suspect this may be
a generic characteristic.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN TRILLIUM.</h3>

<h4><i>Trillium sessile, var. Californicum</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Like a small turnip. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Usually several from the
same root; a foot or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Three at the top of the stem;
three to eight inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;White to deep wine-color.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;One to four inches long. (Otherwise as <i>T. ovatum</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
San Luis Obispo to Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f097"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f097.png">CALIFORNIAN TRILLIUM&mdash;<i>Trillium sessile, var. Californicum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>We begin to look for the Californian <i>Trillium</i> early in the
spring. Little companies of the plants may be seen upon low
flats under the trees, where the soil is rich. The small, turnip-like
tubers usually send up several stems, which lean gracefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[ 262]</a></span>
away from one another. The large leaves are often like pieces
of decorated china that have been several times through the
kiln. They have various superimposed blotchings, the latest
of which are dark, sharp, cuneiform characters, mysterious
hieroglyphs of Nature, which might reveal wondrous secrets,
could we but decipher them. The blossoms have a strong,
heavy fragrance, and are exceedingly variable in color, ranging
from pure white to lilac, deep wine, and even black-purple.
These plants are much admired in the East and in Europe,
where they are cultivated in the garden.</p>


<h3>BRODIÆA. CLUSTER-LILY. WILD HYACINTH.</h3>

<h4><i>Brodiæa capitata</i>, Benth. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Corm.</i>&mdash;Small; scaly-coated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Linear; a foot or more
long; passing away early. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Four inches to over two feet high.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Deep violet to white; six to ten lines long. <i>Bracts.</i>&mdash;Sometimes
deep, rich purple. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;With oblong tube and campanulate,
six-parted limb. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; on the corolla; the inner with
an appendage on each side; the outer naked. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style stout. Stigma three-lobed. <i>Hab</i>.&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>This beautiful <i>Brodiæa</i> grows all over the hills in early
spring, and steals into cultivated fields, where it luxuriates in
the freshly stirred soil and lifts its fine violet-colored clusters
above the waving grain. It holds quite as warm a place in
our affections as the more gorgeous poppy. These blossoms
will keep a long time after being gathered, and are used every
year in lavish profusion in the decorations of the flower carnivals.</p>

<p>The little bulbs, eaten raw, are quite palatable, and are
eagerly sought by the children, who call them "grass-nuts."
The early Spanish-Californians also appreciated them, and
knew them as "saitas." They have a number of other common
names, such as "Spanish-lily," "cluster-lily," "wild hyacinth,"
and "hog-onion"; but I must protest against the
injustice of this latter, and beg all flower-lovers to discountenance
it.</p>

<p>Closely resembling the above, is <i>B. multiflora</i>, Benth. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[ 264]</a></span>
has, however, but three stamens, the other three being represented
by staminodia, which are entire and of the same length
as the stamens.</p>

<p><i>B. congesta</i>, Smith, another similar species, is often four
feet tall. It also has three stamens and three staminodia; but
the latter are deeply cleft and exceed the anthers. This is
called "ookow" by the Indians.</p>


<h3>BROWN LILY. MISSION-BELLS. BRONZE-BELLS.
RICE-ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Fritillaria lanceolata</i>, Pursh. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;A foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;In scattered whorls; lanceolate;
two to five inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;One to several; open campanulate;
greenish or black-purple; variously checkered or mottled.
<i>Perianth-segments.</i>&mdash;Strongly arched, with a large oblong nectary.

</div></div>

<p>One of the oddest and most beautiful flowers of our rich
woodlands is the brown lily, or <i>Fritillaria</i>. It is unrivaled in
elegance, for every line of its contour is a study in grace. Nor
do its charms cease with stem and leaf and flower; for, hidden
away in the rich leaf-mold, is one of its most beautiful features,
its bulb. This is pure, shining white, conical in form, and surrounded
by many tiny bulblets, like grains of rice, which crumble
away from it at a touch. If you go into the woods in early
spring, you will often see certain handsome, broad, shining,
solitary leaves, close to the ground, and you will wonder what
they are. Often near them there are many tiny leaves of the
same sort pushing their way aboveground; and sometimes
among them all there is a solitary strong scape, with unfolding
leaves and a promise of flowers. This is a colony of the beautiful
brown lilies. The tiny leaves are the product of the little
rice-grains, and are probably now seeing the light for the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[ 266]</a></span>
time. Between these and the large leaves the breadth of the
hand, are many sizes, in all stages. The broad leaves may be
from bulbs four or five years old, but they will send up no
blossom-stalk this year; for there is rarely or never a radical-leaf
and a blossom-stalk from the same bulb at once.</p>

<div class="image" id="f099"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f099.png">BROWN LILY&mdash;<i>Fritillaria lanceolata</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>When the plant is about to flower, the bulb sends up a tall
stalk, with here and there a whorl of shining leaves, hanging at
the summit its string of pendent bronze-bells. These are mottled
and checkered, and are of varying shades, from dull green
to black-purple, and often have a beautiful bloom upon them.
Their modest colors blend so nicely into the shadowy scene
about, that it is difficult to see them unless the eye is somewhat
practiced.</p>

<p>Following the inflorescence comes a beautiful and unique
seed-vessel, curiously winged and angled, and of a delicate,
papery texture when mature. It contains the thin, flat seeds,
neatly packed in six ranks.</p>

<p>The flowers are usually an inch long, though they are sometimes
two inches long. A plant was once found three and a
half feet high, with a chime of nineteen bells.</p>


<h3>BLACK LILY. CHOCOLATE-LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Fritillaria biflora</i>, Lindl. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from San Diego to Mendocino County.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have a number of species of <i>Fritillaria</i>, most of them
with beautiful flowers. They fall naturally into two groups,
according to the character of the bulb; <i>F. lanceolata</i> and <i>F.
biflora</i> being types of the two groups.</p>

<p><i>F. biflora</i>, the black, or chocolate, lily, is the species common
in the south, and blooms early. It closely resembles <i>F.
lanceolata</i>, but can always be distinguished by its bulb, which is
composed of several erect, short, easily separable scales. Its
specific name is an unfortunate one; for, far from being confined
to two flowers, it often has as many as ten.</p>

<p><i>F. pluriflora</i>, Torr., found upon the upper Sacramento, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[ 267]</a></span>
flowers of a uniform reddish-purple, without mottling or spots.
It has a comparatively large bulb, an inch or so long, formed
of separate scales.</p>

<p><i>F. pudica</i>, Spreng., found on the eastern slopes of the
Sierras, has solitary yellow flowers.</p>

<p><i>F. liliacea</i>, Lindl., is our only white species. This is found
upon the hills of San Francisco and in the Sacramento Valley.
It has a whorl of leaves near the ground and two or three
greenish-white, nodding flowers. It is exceedingly local.</p>


<h3>LARGE-FLOWERED PHACELIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Phacelia grandiflora</i>, Gray. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Coarse, glandular-viscid plants; one to three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Round-ovate;
irregularly toothed; sometimes three or four inches long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Lavender to white; variously streaked and veined with
purple. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Rotate; two inches across; without scalelike appendages
in the throat. <i>Filaments.</i>&mdash;Long; purple. Anthers large;
versatile. Style two-cleft. (See <i>Phacelia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Santa Barbara
to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is the largest-flowered of all our <i>Phacelias</i>. Its tall
stems are abundantly covered above with the fine-looking
blossoms. These are very attractive to the uninitiated, who
usually rushes forward in breathless haste to possess himself of
these new-found treasures and is rarely satisfied with less than
a large bunch of them. But woe lies in wait for him. The
innumerable glands, covering the whole plant, readily yield up
their viscid fluid, which in a few moments turns everything
with which it comes in contact to a deep red-brown, like iron-rust.
If he escape with ruined clothing, and hands the color
of a red Indian, he will have come off well&mdash;for the plant
poisons some people.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>P. viscida</i>, Torr.&mdash;found in about the
same range as the above, resembles it closely. It is a foot or
so high, branching from the base, and has blue flowers, with
purple or white centers, and only half the size of the above.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[ 268]</a></span></p>


<h3>VIOLET NIGHTSHADE.</h3>

<h4><i>Solanum Xanti</i>, Gray. Nightshade Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Herbaceous nearly to the base; viscid-pubescent, with jointed hairs.
<i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two inches or less long; sometimes
with lobes at the base; thin. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;An inch or so across.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Violet, with green spots ringed with
white at the base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five. Filaments short. Anthers erect;
opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style filiform; exserted.
<i>Berries.</i>&mdash;Purple; six lines in diameter. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>These plants are especially abundant in the south, where
one encounters them upon every roadside. The clusters of
violet flowers are very handsome, and often have the perfume
of the wild rose.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>S. umbelliferum</i>, Esch.&mdash;is so nearly
like the above as to be often confounded with it. But it has
smaller, thicker leaves, the hairs are branched, and it is more
woody below, with shorter flowering branches.</p>

<p>We once saw, in an ideal Japanese villa among the redwoods,
a rustic arbor over which had been trained the rough,
woody stems of one of these nightshades. The genius of these
wise little people, who had adapted this pretty woodland
climber to sylvan cultivation, seemed to us worthy of emulation.</p>


<h3>GREEN-BANDED MARIPOSA. NOONA.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus macrocarpus</i>, Dougl. Lily Family</h4>

<p>Nature has sent this, one of the finest and most elegant of
all our <i>Mariposas</i>, to beautify the arid sagebrush deserts of our
northeastern boundary. In Europe it is admired beyond all
our other species, and there is a great demand for the bulbs.
Its large flowers are of a beautiful lilac, similar in tone to the
Marie Louise violet, and each pointed petal has a green band
running down its center.</p>

<div class="image" id="f100"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f100.png">VIOLET NIGHTSHADE&mdash;<i>Solanum Xanti</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>Among the Indians of their native region the rather large
bulbs of these plants are known as "noonas," and regarded as
a priceless delicacy. Even those who have never experienced
the bliss of tasting them know them by reputation as the acme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[ 270]</a></span>
of all that is delicious. When Mr. Johnson, of Astoria, wished
to secure a number of the bulbs for the European market, he
hired the squaws to dig them, but found that they ate them as
fast as they dug them; and it was only by offering them most
liberal stores of bacon and flour he could induce them to
restrain their appetites and part with the treasure.</p>


<h3>SKULLCAP.</h3>

<h4><i>Scutellaria tuberosa</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several inches high, or at length trailing, and a foot long;
from small tubers. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;One inch long and less; not aromatic.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Axillary; blue-purple. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six
lines or more long; tubular; bilabiate. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in pairs; ascending;
contained in the helmet. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets.
Style filiform. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Hillsides, from San Diego northward; probably
throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The bright-green herbage and the rich purple-blue flowers
of the little skullcap may be looked for early in February. In
the north they grow upon dry, stony hill-slopes under the
chaparral, while southward they often affect the walls of cañons,
among moist, luxuriant vegetation.</p>

<p>Though borne in the axils of the opposite leaves, the pretty
blossoms, by a twist of their pedicels, stand side by side in
pairs, in a very sociable way. The curious little two-lipped
calyx resembles an old-fashioned Quaker bonnet.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>S. angustifolia</i>, Pursh.&mdash;has linear to
oblong leaves, an inch long; flowers an inch or more long, the
lower lobe of whose corolla is hairy within, and the root is not
tuberous. It is otherwise like the above.</p>

<p><i>S. Californica</i>, Gray, is very similar to the last species, but
has cream-white flowers. This is found in early summer upon
dry banks.</p>

<div class="image" id="f101"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a></span>

<h3>CORAL-ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Corallorhiza Bigelovii</i>, Wats. Orchis Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[ 272]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Leafless plants, with coral-like roots. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Flesh-colored; six
to twenty-four inches high, with two to four scarious, sheathing bracts.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Few to many; sessile. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Of six segments. The
five upper yellowish, striped with purple. The lip yellowish, tipped
with deep red-purple. <i>Anther.</i>&mdash;One; resting upon the column like a
lid; falling early. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Central and northern
Coast Ranges and Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>The coral-root is very rare in some localities, and one may
not meet it more than a few times. But there are favored
spots where its flesh-colored stems rear themselves luxuriantly.
One year I saw a magnificent bunch of them in the hands of
some friends who were taking them to San Francisco to furnish
a rare and costly decoration for some festive occasion. Some
of the stems were two feet tall and thickly covered above with
the odd flowers, making a cluster which it would be difficult to
equal for quiet elegance of coloring.</p>

<p>The plants are often found in redwood groves or upon
wooded hill-slopes of north exposure, where the dull stems
and flowers blend so nicely into the dead needles and leaves
upon the ground that it is difficult to detect their presence.</p>

<p>As its name indicates, the root is the counterpart of a spray
of branching coral.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>C. multiflora</i>, Nutt.&mdash;has stems of a
colder purple; and the lip of the flower is white, spotted with
purple, somewhat fan-shaped and three-lobed.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA LILAC. BLUE MYRTLE.
BLUE-BLOSSOM.</h3>

<h4><i>Ceanothus thyrsiflorus</i>, Esch. Buckthorn Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[ 274]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Varying from small, prostrate shrubs in exposed places, to erect
shrubs or small trees. <i>Branches.</i>&mdash;Strongly angled; not spiny. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Elliptical;
twelve to eighteen lines long; three-nerved; smooth and
shining above. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright to pale blue, rarely white; in dense
clusters about three inches long, terminating the usually elongated,
somewhat leafy peduncles. <i>Capsules.</i>&mdash;Globose; two lines in diameter;
smooth, not crested; slightly lobed. (See <i>Ceanothus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near
the coast, from Monterey northward into Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the spring our chaparral-covered slopes begin to take on
a bluish tinge, like the misty smoke of distant camp-fires, for
which the blossoms of the California lilac are responsible. This
is a graceful evergreen shrub, with rich, shining leaves, among
which the abundant feathery clusters of tiny blue flowers find a
charming setting. The blossoms are deliciously fragrant, filling
the cool air with perfume.</p>

<p>This shrub is never found far away from the coast, and it
reaches its greatest beauty in Mendocino County, where it
becomes a tree, sometimes thirty-five feet high. Its wood is
exceedingly brittle. In early days it used to be cultivated in
San Francisco gardens before it was crowded out by foreign
shrubs, often far less worthy.</p>

<p>It is known in some localities as "blue myrtle," and in
others as "blue-blossom." The name "California lilac," by
which it is most often known, is more generally and more
appropriately applied to this species of <i>Ceanothus</i> than to any
of the others.</p>

<p>The dark seeds are a favorite food of the quail.</p>

<h3>BLUE LARKSPUR. ESPUELA DEL CABALLERO.</h3>

<h4><i>Delphinium</i>, Tourn. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[ 276]</a></span></p>

<p>California is rich in beautiful larkspurs, but the species are
very difficult of determination and not well defined as yet.
We have two well-marked scarlet species; but confusion still
reigns among the blue and the white. Some of the latter are
poisonous to sheep and cattle, causing great losses to the herds
every year in some localities.</p>

<p>Among the blue larkspurs are some of our handsomest
spring flowers. Their slender wands, covered with magnificent
large blossoms, rise abundantly on every side upon some
of the mesas of our seashore, making charming flower-gardens
upon the plains. They are so lavishly bestowed that every comer
may gather his fill and still none be missed. In color they
are matchless&mdash;of the richest of Mazarin blue and purple-blue.</p>

<p>Other species are to be found upon the slopes of interior
valleys and scattered all through the Coast Ranges and the
Sierra foothills. In midsummer, which is the vernal springtime
of the mountains, many lovely species deck the alpine meadows
and brooksides.</p>

<p>The Spanish-Californians have a pretty title for these blossoms&mdash;"espuela
del caballero"&mdash;"the cavalier's spur."</p>

<h3>CAT'S-EARS. PUSSY'S-EARS.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus Maweanus</i>, Leichtlein. Lily Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[ 278]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges and Sierras, from San Francisco and
Butte County to the Willamette Valley.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is an exceedingly pretty little <i>Calochortus</i>, much resembling
<i>C. Benthami</i> in form, but having pure-white or
purplish-blue flowers, which are also covered with hairs and
delicately fringed with hairs on the margin. Its stems are
low, slender, and graceful, without bulblets at the base; and
the gland upon the petals has a transverse scale covering its
upper portion.</p>

<p>This plant belongs to the section of <i>Calochortus</i> whose
species are known as "star-tulips." In the Coast Ranges, in
early spring, the blossoms are found in moist meadows near
the sea, where they nestle amid the grasses.</p>

<p>The children are specially fond of them, and know them as
"cat's-ears" and "pussy's-ears."</p>

<p><i>C. uniflorus</i>, Hook. and Arn., found in wet meadows from
San Francisco northward, has lilac to rose-purple flowers.
Its petals are hairy on the lower third, and its stems bear small
bulblets at the base underground.</p>

<p><i>C. umbellatus</i>, Wood., is very similar to <i>C. Maweanus</i>;
but its pure-white petals are almost without hairs, and its stem
is without bulblets. This is found blooming in March and
April on the low mountains of Contra Costa and Marin
Counties.</p>


<h3>PURPLE NEMOPHILA.</h3>

<h4><i>Nemophila aurita</i>, Lindl. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to three feet long; square; angled; weak; very brittle;
with backward-pointing, hooked bristles. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All with a dilated,
clasping, eared base or winged petiole; above deeply pinnatifid into
five to nine oblong or lanceolate, downward-pointing lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Violet;
an inch or so across. (Otherwise as <i>Nemophila insignis</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Francisco to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f105"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f105.png"><i>CAT'S-EARS&mdash;Calochortus Maweanus.</i></a></p>
</div>

<p>The purple <i>Nemophila</i> is most abundant in the south,
growing everywhere in early springtime upon hillsides partially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[ 280]</a></span>
shaded. Its long, coarse, hispid stems run riot over
small undershrubs or dead or unsightly brushwood, often completely
covering them with a mound of foliage thickly sown
with the dull-purple flowers.</p>

<p>At first it is difficult to realize that this plant of coarse habit
belongs to the sisterhood of baby-eyes, those delicate, ethereal
favorites of the springtime. In fact, one's first impression of
it is that it is some new species of nightshade. One learns,
however, to have a fondness for these blossoms and a growing
desire to gather them; but their tangling, quarrelsome habit
forbids one, if any other flowers are in question.</p>

<p>It is said that the dark-eyed señoritas of early days decked
their ball-dresses with sprays of this flower, which clung gracefully
to the thin fabrics.</p>


<h3>GROUND-IRIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Iris macrosiphon</i>, Torr. Iris Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p>Almost stemless plants, often forming mats. <i>Rhizome.</i>&mdash;Slender.
<i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Grasslike; six to fifteen inches long. <i>Buds.</i>&mdash;One or
two; borne in sheathing bracts. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;On short pedicels; deep
purple-blue, marked with white. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;With slender tube one
to three inches long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three; borne under the petaloid
divisions of the style. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Oblong-ovoid;
shortly acute at each end; one inch long. Seeds in two rows
in each cell; compressed and angled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from
San Mateo to Trinity County.</p></blockquote>

<p>When spring is at its height, this charming little <i>Iris</i> may
be found upon sunny, open hillsides among the unrolling crosiers
of the common brake. There is something peculiarly
captivating about these blossoms, with their satisfying richness
of hue and perfect symmetry of form, added to which is a
sweet, delicate perfume, an ideal exhalation of the springtime.</p>

<p>As the buds unfold beautifully in water, it is better to
gather buds than flowers, as the latter are too fragile to carry
without breaking.</p>

<div class="image" id="f106"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f106.png">GROUND-IRIS&mdash;<i>Iris macrosiphon</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p><i>I. longipetala</i>, Herb., is the common bog-iris of our central
coast. It grows in large clumps in wet places, and while
not a delicate flower, it has a certain brave, hardy look as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[ 282]</a></span>
stands out upon the wind-swept downs of the Coast. Its
stems are rather stout, a foot or two high, and have from three
to five large lilac flowers. The sepals are veined with deeper
lilac and blotched with orange.</p>


<h3>WILD HELIOTROPE. VERVENIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Phacelia tanacetifolia</i>, Benth. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high; rough and hairy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Much
divided. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright violet to blue; in clustered, scorpioid
racemes. <i>Calyx-lobes.</i>&mdash;Linear or linear-spatulate. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six
lines long. Style two-cleft. (See <i>Phacelia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the
western part of the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild heliotrope is one of the most abundant flowers of
midspring, especially in the south. It affects the gravelly
banks of streams or the sandy soil of mesas; or grows all
along the railroad embankments, making great mounds of
foliage, thickly sown with the bright violet-blue blossoms; or
it may often be seen clambering up through small shrubs,
seeming to seek the support of their stiff branches. It is needless
to say that this is not a true heliotrope, but belongs to the
closely allied genus, <i>Phacelia</i>.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i>tanacetifolia</i>, meaning with tansy-like
leaves, is more applicable to the <i>var. tenuifolia</i>, Thurber.
Among the Spanish-Californians it is known as "vervenía."</p>

<p>It is a very important honey-plant.</p>

<p><i>P. Douglasii</i>, Torr., is a species with lavender corolla with
much the aspect of the baby-blue-eyes. This is common in
the western part of the State, south of Monterey, and is found
sparingly north of that point.</p>

<h3>BLUE-EYED GRASS. AZULEA. VILLELA.</h3>

<h4><i>Sisyrinchium bellum</i>, Wats. Iris Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[ 284]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical; grasslike; shorter than the stems. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Flat;
clustered; six to eighteen inches high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Four to seven; contained
in two nearly equal sheathing bracts. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Six-parted;
purplish-blue, with yellow center; six lines to an inch across. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Three.
Filaments united. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style filiform.
Stigma spindle-shaped; three-cleft after fertilization. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
California.</p>

<p>The blue-eyed grass is such a modest flower, one would
never suspect it to be closely allied to the regal <i>Iris</i>. In late
spring its quiet stars are found in our meadows everywhere.
In the south it grows so luxuriantly and so determinedly that
it has become a serious pest to the farmer, crowding more
useful plants from the pasture.</p>

<p>Owing to the quaint manner in which its petals kink up
when they fade, these blossoms are called "nigger-babies" by
the children. Among the Spanish-Californians the plant is
known as "azulea" and "villela," and is made into a tea,
which is considered a valuable remedy in fevers. It is thought
that a patient can subsist for many days upon it alone.</p>

<p><i>S. Californicum</i>, Ait., the "golden-eyed grass," with bright
yellow flowers, is found in wet places all up and down the
Coast.</p>


<h3>BABY-EYES. BLUE-VEINED NEMOPHILA.</h3>

<h4><i>Nemophila intermedia</i>, Bioletti. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;With petioles somewhat widened at base and ciliate; the
upper all opposite. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Nine to twelve lines wide; light blue to
white; distinctly blue-veined or more or less sown with purple dots.
Scales of the corolla long, narrow, hairy, with expanded tips extending
nearly to the sinuses. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Rounded; with twelve to twenty-four
ovules. (Otherwise as <i>N. insignis</i>.) <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Nemophila Menziesii</i>,
Hook. and Arn. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Rather widespread.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f108"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f108.png">BLUE-EYED GRASS&mdash;<i>Sisyrinchium bellum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>This beautiful <i>Nemophila</i> is a more fragile flower than its
sister, the baby-blue-eyes. Its delicate corolla is usually white
in the center, blending to azure-blue upon the rim, and dotted
and veined with the same. At its best, it is an inch across. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[ 286]</a></span>
affects the borders of moist woodlands, rarely venturing far out
into the openings. There it nestles amid the tender herbage,
often producing its ethereal flowers in such profusion that it
seems as though bits of the sky had fallen to earth. In the
south these blossoms do not seem so truly at home&mdash;for they
are never so large nor so fine.</p>


<h3>CALIFORNIAN MILKWORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Polygala Californica</i>, Nutt. Milkwort Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to eight inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Six to twelve lines
long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Rose-purple. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five; two of them large and
spreading like wings; six lines or less long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Three; united to
each other and to the stamen-tube; the middle one hooded above and
beaked. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight. Filaments united into a sheath, which is
open above. Anthers one-celled; opening terminally. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
Style enlarging upward; curved like a button-hook. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Rounded;
flat; three or four lines across. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>P. cucullata</i>, Benth.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges southward to Santa Barbara and beyond.</p></blockquote>

<p>In late spring the little flowers of the milkwort are common
upon dry hill-slopes in the shade of the trees. The small plants
have a very grown-up look, as though their age might be
greater than indicated by their stature. At first glance, one is
quite certain to mistake these plants for members of the pea
family, as the blossoms have wings and a keel like the papilionaceous
flower. But a careful counting of sepals, petals, and
stamens will reveal their separate identity.</p>

<p>A curious feature of this plant is the fact that it bears
another kind of flower near the root. This is without petals,
and is destined, for some strange reason, to bear the seed.
The upper flowers seem mostly for show, though one does
occasionally mature fruit.</p>

<p><i>P. cornuta</i>, Kell., found in the Sierras, is a larger plant,
with greenish-white flowers.</p>

<h3>WILD CANTERBURY-BELL.</h3>

<h4><i>Phacelia Whitlavia</i>, Gray. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[ 288]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>A foot or so high; very hairy and glandular. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
petioled; ovate or deltoid; toothed; twelve to eighteen lines long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purple. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;An inch or more
long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; on the base of the corolla; appendaged at
base; long-exserted, with the two-cleft style. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled.
<i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Whitlavia grandiflora</i>, Harv. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Los Angeles to
San Bernardino.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild Canterbury-bell is one of the most charming
flowers to be found anywhere. It affects the rich soil of half-shaded
hill-slopes in the vicinity of streams, where it opens its
beautiful fragile bells. Its stems are very brittle, and the blossoms
fall early, the lower ones usually having passed away
before the upper buds have emerged from the coil. The
exceedingly long stamens and style give these blossoms an elegant,
airy look.</p>

<p><i>P. Parryi</i>, Torr., is another beautiful species, found from
Los Angeles to San Diego. It resembles the above in foliage,
color of blossoms, and the long stamens; but the form of the
flowers is that of the <i>Nemophila</i>.</p>


<h3>BIRD'S-EYES.</h3>

<h4><i>Gilia tricolor</i>, Benth. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; branching; six inches to a foot or more high.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Twice pinnately parted into narrow linear lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six
lines long; with yellow tube; funnel-form throat, marked with deep
violet-purple; and lilac or white limb. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
Western California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whole slopes are often carpeted with this dainty <i>Gilia</i>, producing
an effect which has been described as like light chinchilla.
The little blossoms have a peculiarly fresh and winsome
look, and are called "bird's-eyes" by the children. The
corollas are delicate lilac, blending into white toward the center,
while the throat has five purple spots within, which give way
to bright gold below.</p>

<h3>BABY-BLUE-EYES. CALIFORNIAN BLUEBELLS.
MARIANAS.</h3>

<h4><i>Nemophila insignis</i>, Dougl. Baby-eyes or Waterleaf Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[ 290]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Tender, more or less hairy herbs. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Branching; six to twelve
inches long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Pinnately parted into five to nine small, oblong,
entire or two- to five-lobed divisions. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted, with five
extra, alternating, reflexed lobes. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;An inch or more across;
from azure-blue, with a large, well-defined white center, more or less
dotted, to deep blue. The throat furnished with ten short, wide, hairy
scales, or plates. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; on the corolla. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style two-cleft. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>When skies are smiling and the earth is already clothed with
a luxuriant and tender herbage, we find upon some balmy
morning that the baby-eyes have opened in gentle surprise
upon the lovely world. The spring breezes blow over no
more beautiful and ethereal flowers than these. Companies of
them open together, dotting the sward and luring us on from
one to another, the one just beyond always seeming a little
brighter blue or a little more captivating than those near at
hand, till we are beguiled into filling our hands with them.</p>

<p>These delicate blossoms vary greatly in size and color. The
largest and finest I ever saw grew upon the flower-sprinkled
slopes of Lake Merced, near San Francisco. There the perfect
azure corollas were an inch and a half across, with the large
white circle in the center well defined.</p>

<p>Under southern skies it becomes a deep Yale blue, with the
texture of tissue-paper, and with dark red-brown anthers.</p>

<p>From the campanulate, half-opened buds, it has been called
"Californian bluebell," and among the Spanish-Californians it
is known as "Mariana."</p>

<h3>LILAC SAND-VERBENA. WILD LANTANA.</h3>

<h4><i>Abronia villosa</i>, Wats. Four-o'clock Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[ 292]</a></span></p>

<p>Plants with more or less glandular-villous pubescence. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Prostrate.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Rarely an inch long. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;One to three
inches long; five- to fifteen-flowered. <i>Involucral bracts.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate;
three or four lines long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Lilac; four or five lines across;
with obcordate lobes. (Otherwise as <i>A. latifotia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Diego
and eastward; also in southern deserts.</p>

<p>The charming flowers of the lilac sand-verbena are not found
upon the immediate sea-beach, but always a little withdrawn
from it, where the soil is more firmly established, yet within
sight and sound of the waves. The blossoms have a delicate
beauty, not shared by our other species of <i>Abronia</i>, and somewhat
resemble our garden verbenas. They are sometimes
called "wild lantana."</p>

<p><i>A. umbellata</i>, Lam., is common all up and down our coast,
often making masses of deep pink on the beach; while <i>A. maritima</i>,
Nutt., is found from Santa Barbara to San Diego. The
latter is a very stout, coarse, viscid plant, with small, very deep
magenta flowers.</p>


<h3>CAMASS. KAMASS. WILD HYACINTH.</h3>

<h4><i>Camassia esculenta</i>, Lindl. Lily Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p>Bulbs coated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical; six or eight; grasslike; three to
eight lines broad; usually shorter than the scape. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Twelve to
twenty-four inches high; loosely ten- to twenty-flowered. Pedicels
three to twelve lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;From dark blue to nearly white;
seven to fifteen lines long or more; an inch or so across. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Of
six distinct, oblanceolate, three- to seven-nerved segments. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six;
shorter than the segments. Anthers yellow. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled.
Style filiform; about equaling the perianth; slightly three-cleft
at the summit. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Central California to Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>In some localities these plants are found covering meadows
and marshy tracts in great profusion. They bear beautiful
clusters of showy blue flowers, somewhat like the hyacinth in
habit, and have long been favorites in European gardens. We
are especially interested in them, however, on account of the
bulbs, which are about an inch in diameter and very nutritious.</p>

<p>Grizzly bears, when more plentiful in the early days, were
particularly fond of them; and the northern Indians to-day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[ 293]</a></span>
value them very highly as an article of diet, calling them
"kamáss." Indeed, the Nez Percé Indian war in Idaho was
caused by encroachments upon the territory which was especially
rich in these bulbs. The plants are more abundant
north of us than with us.</p>

<p>Mr. Macoun gives a most interesting account in "Garden
and Forest" of the preparation of kamáss among the Indians,
which is a very important and elaborate performance. He
says, in substance: For some days beforehand the squaws
were busily engaged in carrying into camp branches of alder
and maple, bundles of skunk-cabbage (<i>Lysichiton</i>), and a quantity
of a black, hairlike lichen, which grows in profusion upon
the western larch. A hole ten feet square and two feet deep
was then dug, and a large fire was made in this, in which they
heated a great many small boulders to the glowing point.
They then piled maple and alder boughs over these to the
depth of a foot or more, tramped them down, and laid over
them the leaves of the skunk-cabbage. Thin sheets of tamarack
bark were spread over the steaming green mass, and
upon these were placed the bulbs in large baskets. The black
lichen was laid over the uncovered bark, and the remaining
bulbs were spread on this. The whole was then covered with
boughs and leaves as before, and sand was sprinkled on to
the depth of four or five inches, and on the top of the whole a
larger fire than before was built. The sun was just setting
when this was lighted, and it burned all night. The oven was
left for a day to cool. When opened, the bulbs in the baskets
were dissolved to a flour, from which bread could be made;
while those on the lichen had become amalgamated with it,
forming a substance resembling plug-tobacco, which could be
broken up and kept sweet a long time.</p>

<p>When boiled in water, the bulbs yield a very good molasses,
much prized by the Indians, and used by them upon important
festival occasions.</p>

<p>There is a white-flowered form of this same species, whose
bulb is said to be poisonous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[ 294]</a></span></p>


<h3>INNOCENCE. COLLINSIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Collinsia bicolor</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;The lower oblong; the upper
ovate-lanceolate. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Unequally five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Nine lines
long. Upper lip lilac or white; lower of three lobes; the middle folded
into a keeled sac containing the stamens and style; the two lateral
rose-purple. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in two pairs on the corolla. Upper
filaments bearded. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style filiform. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
Western California.</p>

<p>Where spreading trees cast a dense shade and the moisture
still lingers, companies of lovely <i>Collinsias</i> stand amid the fresh
green grasses, their delicate, many-storied blossoms swaying
upon the idle breezes. In the north these are in the rear guard
of spring flowers, and make their appearance just before the
<i>Godetias</i> bid farewell to spring; but in the south they come
earlier. They vary much in color, from the typical rose-purple
and white or lilac to all white.</p>

<p>We have a number of species; but <i>C. bicolor</i> is the most
showy and widespread.</p>


<h3>BLACK SAGE. BALL-SAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Audibertia stachyoides</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>


<blockquote><p>Shrubby; three to eight feet high; with herbaceous flowering
branches. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; oblong-lanceolate; tapering into a
petiole; crenate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In interrupted spikes, having from three
to nine dense, rather remote, headlike, bracteate whorls. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate;
each lip with two or three awned teeth. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Lavender;
six lines long; bilabiate. Upper lip erect; emarginate; lower
deflexed; three-lobed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Two sterile; two perfect on jointed
filaments. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. Style slender. Stigma
two-cleft. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Francisco Bay to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>We have but two or three true sages, or <i>Salvias</i>, in California;
but the plants of the closely allied genus <i>Audibertia</i>
are with perfect propriety called sages, as they manifest all the
characteristics of that genus, differing only in the structure of
the stamens. There are a number of species of <i>Audibertia</i>,
all of them important honey-plants. They are particularly
abundant in the south, where they form a characteristic feature
in the landscape, often covering whole hill-slopes.</p>

reaches of mountain-side, and when in full bloom is very noticeable.
Its specific name is a happy one, denoting its resemblance
to the <i>Stachys</i>, or hedge-nettle. But its pointed leaves,
shrubby habit, and rank odor, together with its more numerous
flower-whorls, proclaim its separate identity.</p>

<p><i>A. nivea</i>, Benth., found from Santa Barbara to San Diego,

<h3>BLUE GILIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Cilia Chamissonis</i>, Greene. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>

<p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;About a foot high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; dissected into
linear segments. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In capitate clusters an inch and a half
across; deep blue. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Four lines long;
with five obtuse lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Exserted. Anthers nearly white.
(See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast of Central California.</p>

<p>This pretty <i>Gilia</i> is quite common about San Francisco in
springtime, and often makes masses of bright deep blue over
the fields.</p>

<p><i>G. capitata</i>, Dougl., is a closely allied species, found in the
Coast Ranges from Central California northward. This is in
every way a more delicate plant. Its stems are taller and
more slender; its flower-heads are less than an inch across,
and composed of very small light-blue flowers, with feathery,
exserted stamens.</p>

<p><i>G. achilleæfolia</i>, Benth., is a beautiful form, closely related
to both the above, but quite variable in habit. Its flowers are
light lavender-blue, six lines or so long, and are borne in larger
clusters, often two inches across, on long, naked peduncles.
At a little distance these blossoms somewhat resemble the
clusters of <i>Brodiæa capitata</i>.</p>

<h3>CHIA. SAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Salvia Columbariæ</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[ 298]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Wrinkly; one to
several inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Blue; in interrupted whorls. <i>Whorls.</i>&mdash;Twelve
to eighteen lines in diameter; subtended by numerous,
ovate-acuminate bracts. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate; upper lip arching, and
tipped with two short bristles; lower, of two awn-like teeth. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Three
or four lines long; bilabiate. Upper lip erect; notched or
two-lobed. Lower deflexed; with three lobes, the central much larger.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Two. Filaments two; short; apparently forked&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> bearing
on their summit a cross-bar having on one end a perfect anther-cell
and on the other a dwarfed or rudimentary one. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four
seedlike nutlets. Style slender. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State, specially
southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This rough-leaved sage is quite common, especially southward,
and grows upon dry hillsides or in sandy washes, where
it blossoms in early spring. Its small bright-blue flowers are
borne in an interrupted spike, consisting of from one to four
button-like heads. Each of these heads has below it a number
of leafy bracts, which are often of a bright wine-color, and form
a rather striking combination with the blue flowers.</p>

<p>After the blossoms have passed away, the dried stems and
heads remain standing all over the hills, shaking out the little
gray seed in abundance. These seeds have been for centuries
an article of economic importance to the aborigines and their
descendants. Dr. Rothrock writes that among the Nahua
races of ancient Mexico the plant was cultivated as regularly as
corn, and was one of their most important cereals. Quantities
of the seed have been found buried beneath groves which must
be at least several hundred years old. It was in use among
the Indians of California before the occupation of the country
by the whites, being known among them as "chia."</p>

<p>Dr. Bard writes of these seeds: "They were roasted,
ground, and used as food by being mixed with water. Thus
prepared, it soon develops into a mucilaginous mass, larger
than its original bulk. Its taste is somewhat like that of linseed
meal. It is exceedingly nutritious, and was readily borne
by the stomach when that organ refused to tolerate other
aliment. An atole, or gruel, of this was one of the peace offerings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[ 300]</a></span>
to the first visiting sailors. One tablespoonful of
these seeds was sufficient to sustain for twenty-four hours an
Indian on a forced march. Chia was no less prized by the
native Californian, and at this late date it frequently commands
six or eight dollars a pound."</p>

<div class="image" id="f114"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f114.png">CHIA&mdash;<i>Salvia Columbariæ</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>When added to water, the seeds make a cooling drink,
which has the effect of assuaging burning thirst&mdash;a very valuable
quality on the desert.</p>


<h3>BLUE-AND-WHITE LUPINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Lupinus bicolor</i>, Lindl. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stoutish; six to ten inches high; silky. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
with small stipules. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Five to seven; linear-spatulate;
one inch long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Four or five lines long; blue and white; the
white changing to red-purple after fertilization. Upper calyx-lip bifid;
lower twice as long; entire. <i>Keel.</i>&mdash;Falcate; acute; ciliate toward the
apex. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Small; about five-seeded. (See <i>Lupinus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Western
Central California.</p></blockquote>

<p>In late spring the open fields about San Francisco take on
a delicate, amethystine tinge, due to the blossoms of the blue-and-white
lupine. After fertilization has taken place, the white
in these blossoms turns to deep red, and this admixture gives
the general lilac tone to the mass.</p>


<h3>DOUGLAS IRIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Iris Douglasiana</i>, Herb. Iris Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rhizomes.</i>&mdash;Stoutish; clumps not dense. <i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Strongly
ribbed underneath; dark, shining green above; one to three feet long;
three to eight lines broad; flexile; rosy pink at base. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Simple;
two- or three-flowered. Flowers.&mdash;On pedicels six to eighteen lines
long; deep reddish-purple, lilac, or cream. <i>Perianth-tube.</i>&mdash;Six to
twelve lines long. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Narrowly oblong; acutely triangular;
twenty lines long. Seeds nearly globular. (Otherwise as <i>I. macrosiphon</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from Santa Cruz to Marin County.</p></blockquote>

<p>On account of the bright and varied hues of its flowers, the
genus <i>Iris</i> was named for the rainbow-winged messenger of
the gods. In France it is known as "fleur-de-lis," a name
whose origin has caused endless discussion and has been accounted
for in many ways. There are many species, all of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[ 302]</a></span>
them beautiful. Orris-root is the product of the lovely white
Florentine <i>Iris</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>In California we have several comparatively well-known
species, and a number of others which are without names as
yet; but the Douglas <i>Iris</i> is probably our most beautiful. It
thrives well upon open mesas or upon well-drained hill-slope
in the shelter of the chaparral. But it is found at its best in
the rich soil of moist woodlands, whose seclusion seems the
most fitting abode for so aristocratic a flower. There, surrounded
by the delicate greenery of fern-fronds and a hundred
other tender, springing things, it seems to hold a sylvan court,
receiving homage from all the other denizens of the wood.
There is a certain marked and personal individuality about
these flowers which makes encountering them seem like meeting
certain distinguished personages.</p>


<h3>ITHURIEL'S SPEAR. BLUE MILLA.</h3>

<h4><i>Brodiæa laxa</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Corm.</i>&mdash;Small; fiber-coated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Usually two; radical; linear
channeled. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Six inches to two feet high. <i>Umbels.</i>&mdash;Of ten
to thirty or more purple or violet, or even white, flowers. <i>Pedicels.</i>&mdash;One
to three inches long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Twelve to twenty lines long.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; in two rows; the upper opposite the inner lobes of the
perianth. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled; on a stalk six lines long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
Kern County to Northern Oregon</p></blockquote>

<p>After the delicate <i>Collinsias</i> have stolen away, the beautiful
flowers of Ithuriel's spear begin to claim our attention in
open grassy spots on the borders of rich woodlands. The
common name is a happy one; for there is something commanding
about this tall blossom-crowned shaft. It will perhaps
be remembered that the angel Ithuriel possessed a truth
compelling spear. When Satan, disguised, went to the Garden of
Eden to tempt Eve, Ithuriel and Zephon were sent to expel
him.</p>

<h3>BEACH-ASTER.</h3>

<h4><i>Erigeron glaucus</i>, Ker. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Six to twelve inches high, having a tuft of radical leaves and some
ascending stems. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Obovate or spatulate-oblong; one to four
inches long; pale; somewhat succulent; slightly viscid. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Composed
of dull-yellow disk-flowers and bright-violet ray-flowers.
<i>Disk.</i>&mdash;Eight lines or so across. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Six or eight lines long; narrow;
numerous; in several rows. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from Oregon to
Southern California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Almost anywhere upon our Coast, "within the roar of a
surf-tormented shore," we can find the beautiful blossoms of
the beach-aster. We may know them by their resemblance to
the China asters of our gardens, though they are not so large.
They present a most delightful combination of color in their
old-gold centers, violet rays, and rather pale foliage.</p>


<h3>TOAD-FLAX.</h3>

<h4><i>Linaria Canadensis</i>, Dumont. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Slender; six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
alternate on the flowering stems, but smaller and broader ones often
opposite or whorled on the procumbent shoots; linear; smooth. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Blue;
in terminal racemes; like those of <i>Antirrhinum</i>, but the
tube furnished with a long, downward-pointing spur at base. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The delicate blue flowers of the toad-flax are not uncommon
in spring, and the plants are usually found in sandy soil.
The little blossoms are very ethereal and have a sweet perfume.
I once saw a deep blue band upon a mesa near San Diego,
which vied in richness with the ultramarine of the sea just beyond.
It stretched for some distance, and at last curved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[ 306]</a></span>
around and crossed the road over which I was passing, when
it proved to be made up of millions of these delicate flowers.
The color effect seemed cumulative, for the mass was so much
richer and deeper than the individual flowers.</p>

<h3>CATALINA MARIPOSA TULIP.</h3>

<h4><i>Calochortus Catalinæ</i>, Wats. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two feet high; loosely branching; bulbiferous. Leaves
and bracts linear-lanceolate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Erect; eighteen lines or so
long. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Green without; scarious-margined; whitish within;
with purple spot at base; one inch long; acute. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;White; with
garnet base; bearing a round gland covered with hairs. Filaments
garnet. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Narrowly oblong; three-sided; obtuse; an inch or
two long. Seeds flat; horizontal. (See <i>Calochortus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
San Luis Obispo County to San Bernardino; and the islands off the
Coast.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of the earliest <i>Mariposas</i> to bloom in the south.
Its beautiful, stately white cups have a garnet base within, and
this, with its oblong, obtuse capsule and horizontal seeds,
clearly identifies it. These blossoms are favorite resting-places
for the bees, who are often beguiled in them from their labors
and lulled to a gentle slumber. We have frequently startled
the little truants from these siestas, and with amusement
watched them struggling for a moment before regaining consciousness
and whizzing away once more upon their round of
duties.</p>

<p>This may be designated our maritime <i>Calochortus</i>, as it is
found mostly near the Coast or upon its islands.</p>

<p><i>C. splendens</i>, Dougl., found in the Coast Ranges from Lake
County to San Diego, is sometimes confused with the above.
It is a beautiful flower, whose petals are a clear rose-lilac without
spots or marks, with long, whitish, cobwebby hairs on their
middle third. Its anthers are purple or lilac, three to six lines
long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[ 307]</a></span></p>


<h3>DOG-VIOLET.</h3>

<h4><i>Viola canina, var. adunca</i>, Gray. Violet Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Leafy; several from the rootstocks. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate; often
somewhat cordate at base; acute or obtuse; six to eighteen lines long;
obscurely crenate. Stipules foliaceous; narrowly lanceolate; lacerately
toothed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Violet or purple; rather large. Lateral petals
bearded. Spur as long as the sepals; rather slender; obtuse; hooked
or curved. (Otherwise as <i>V. pedunculata</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges,
from San Francisco to Washington.</p></blockquote>

</div></div>

<p>Nestling amid the grasses on many a moist mesa by the
sea, the modest flowers of the dog-violet may be found at
almost any time of year. They vary greatly in the length of
their stems, according to the season and the locality of growth.</p>


<h3>THISTLE-SAGE.</h3>

<h4><i>Salvia carduacea</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;All radical; thistle-like; with cobwebby wool. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout;
a foot or two high. <i>Flower-whorls.</i>&mdash;An inch or two through.
<i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate; with five spiny teeth. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Lavender; an
inch long. Upper lip erect; two-cleft. Lower fan-shaped; white-fringed.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;On the lower lip. Proper filaments very short,
with one short and one long fork, each bearing an anther-cell. (Otherwise
like <i>S. Columbariæ</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Western and Southern California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon the dry, open plains of the south, the charming
flowers of the thistle-sage make their appearance by May.
Upon the train we pass myriads of them standing along the
embankments, and seeming to beckon mockingly at us, well
knowing the train almost never stops where we can get them.</p>

<p>These plants present the most remarkable blending of the
rigid, uncompromising, touch-me-not aspect and the ethereal
and fragile. In each of the several stories of the flower-cluster
there are usually a number of the exquisitely delicate
flowers in bloom at once, standing above the hemisphere of
densely crowded, spiny calyx-tips. Nothing more airy or fantastic
could well be imagined than these diaphanous blossoms.
The upper lip of the corolla stands erect, its two lobes side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[ 308]</a></span>
side, or crossed like two delicate little hands. The lower lip
has two small and inconspicuous lateral lobes and one large
central one, which is like the ruff of a fantail pigeon and
daintily fringed with white. The color combination in these
blossoms is charming. To the sage green of the foliage and the
lilac of the blossoms is added the dash of orange in the
anthers that puts the finishing touch. The whole plant has a
heavy, dull odor of sage.</p>

<p>This species is also sometimes called "chia," and its seeds
are used in the same manner as those of our other <i>Salvia</i>, but
to no such extent.</p>


<h3>VIOLET BEARD-TONGUE.</h3>

<h4><i>Pentstemon heterophyllus</i>, Lindl. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Woody at base; many-stemmed. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to five feet tall.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate or linear; or the lowest oblong-lanceolate; diminishing
into narrow floral bracts. <i>Panicle.</i>&mdash;Narrow. Pedicels one- to
three-flowered; short and erect. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Rose-purple, or violet suffused
with pink; an inch or more long; ventricose-funnel-form above
the narrow, slender tube. (See <i>Pentstemon</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Western California,
specially southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The beautiful flowers of the violet beard-tongue are often
seen among the soft browns of our dusty roadsides in early
summer. They are truly charming flowers, and we marvel
how any one can pass them by unnoticed. I have seen them
especially showy in the southern part of the State, in Santa
Barbara and Ventura Counties, where the plants often spread
over two or three feet, sending up innumerable slender flower-covered
wands. The undeveloped buds are of a characteristic
greenish-yellow tone, making an unusual contrast to the expanded
flowers and the rather pale foliage. The structure of
the anthers is quite interesting, each cell consisting of a little
bag with bristly margins, the two together being heart-shaped
in outline.</p>

<p><i>P. azureus</i>, Benth., or the "azure beard-tongue," is very
similar to the above, growing from one to three feet high; but
it is smooth and glaucous; its leaves are inclined to have a
broader base, and its flowers are usually larger, azure blue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[ 310]</a></span>
approaching violet, sometimes having a red-purple tube, while
its border is often an inch across. This is found throughout
the State, but is more common in the interior and in the
Sierras. Its buds are not yellow.</p>

<h3>WILD GINGER.</h3>

<h4><i>Asarum caudatum</i>, Lindl. Birthwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstocks.</i>&mdash;Creeping; aboveground. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; two to
four inches long; heart-shaped; not mottled; shining green. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Raisin-colored.
<i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;With spherical tube and three long-pointed
lobes, thirty lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twelve. Filaments more or less
coherent in groups, adherent to the styles, and produced beaklike beyond
the anthers. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Six-celled. Styles united; equaling the stamens.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges from Santa Cruz to British Columbia.</p></blockquote>

<p>The beautiful long-stemmed leaves of the wild ginger stand
upon the borders of many a shaded cañon stream, seeming to
enjoy the gossiping of the brook as it gurgles by. The leaves
and roots of these plants are aromatic, and the former when
crushed emit a pleasant fragrance, similar to that of the camphor-laurel.
The branching rootstocks, creeping along the
surface of the ground, grow from their tips; which are swathed
in the undeveloped silky leaves.</p>

<p>In the spring a warm hue comes among these closely-folded
leaves, and presently a curious dull-colored bud begins to protrude
its long tip from their midst. This bud looks as though
some worm had eaten off its end; but we soon see that its
blunt appearance is due to the fact that the long prongs of the
sepals are neatly folded in upon themselves, like the jointed
leg of an insect. It must require considerable force in the
flower to unfurl them. When at length expanded, these blossoms
have the look of some rapacious, hobgoblin spider, lurking
for its prey.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>A. Hartwegi</i>, Wats.&mdash;the "Sierra wild
ginger," is easily distinguished from the above by its white-mottled
leaves, which grow in clusters, and by its smaller flowers.
It blooms later than the other, its flowers lasting into July.
These plants are closely related to the "Dutchman's pipe."</p>

and fascicled; linear-lanceolate; short-petioled; two to six inches long.
<i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Erect; slender; often in whorls. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Very small
and numerous; in umbels; white and lavender. <i>Corolla-lobes.</i>&mdash;Two

arising from below the middle of the ovate hoods, and conspicuously
curved over the stigma. <i>Pods.</i>&mdash;Slender; spindle-shaped.
(Structure otherwise as in <i>Gomphocarpus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the
State, and beyond its borders.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of our most widely distributed milkweeds, and
may be found blossoming along our dusty roadsides and
through the fields in early summer. Its stems are tall and
wandlike with long, narrow leaves, and its little blossoms are
very trim. Its distaff-shaped pods, with their beautiful silken
down, are familiar objects, much beloved by the children, and
are sought by older people who utilize them in many dainty
ways.</p>


<h3>CHICORY. SUCCORY. WILD BACHELOR'S-BUTTON.</h3>

sharply incised; the upper reduced to bracts. <i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Bright
blue; sessile; two or three together in the axils of the leaves or terminal;
of ray-flowers only. <i>Rays.</i>&mdash;Ten lines long; about two wide;

from cultivation in many places.</p></blockquote>

<p>The most careless observer will some day have his attention
startled into activity by a certain tall, fine plant growing
along the roadside, bearing beautiful, ragged blue flowers
closely set to its stem. This is a stranger from over the seas,
whose native home is England; and, like all English, it is an
excellent colonist, having pushed its way into most parts of the
civilized world. It has become quite plentiful among us in the
last few years, and whole fields may often be seen covered with
its lovely bright-blue blossoms, which are known as "ragged
sailors," and "wild bachelor's-buttons." They open in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[ 314]</a></span>
early morning, closing by midday. In Europe a popular belief
is rife that they open at eight o'clock in the morning and
close at four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The plant is useful in several ways. Its root is boiled and
eaten as a vegetable; the leaves, when blanched, make an excellent
salad; and the whole plant was formerly employed in
medicine, and is still considered a valuable remedy for jaundice.
But the most common use of it is as a substitute for
coffee, or as an adulterant of it. The fleshy, milky root is
dried, ground, and roasted, and though it has neither the
essential oil nor the delicious aroma of coffee, it is not an
unpleasant beverage, and its cheapness brings it within the
reach of the very poor.</p>

<p>The chicory industry has grown to be of considerable
importance in California of late. The plants are grown in
reclaimed tule land near Stockton, where there is a factory for
the conversion of the root into the commercial article.</p>

linear; obtuse; passing into flower-bracts above. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Racemose;
blue. <i>Calyx-tube.</i>&mdash;Very long and slender; adnate to the
ovary; its limb of five slender divisions. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With short tube
and bilabiate border. The smaller lip of two narrow spreading or
recurved divisions; the larger three-lobed; broader than long; nine
or ten lines by five or six lines. All the lobes intense blue; the large
centers mostly white. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; united into a curved tube.
<i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Splitting at the sides. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Nearly throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>These little lobeliaceous plants are very common, especially
upon the plains of the interior, and may be found growing in
wet places, where they often make the ground blue. The
showy, white-centered flowers are familiar along the roadsides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[ 315]</a></span>
upon the borders of puddles. The blossoms, which are really
stemless, appear to have stems of considerable length, owing
to the very long, slender ovary and calyx-tube. They are
cultivated for ornament under the name of <i>Clintonia pulchella</i>.</p>

<p>We have one other species in the northern part of the
State. It is a larger plant, sometimes a foot tall, with ovate to
lanceolate leaves. This is <i>D. elegans</i>, Torr.</p>


<h3>FALSE INDIGO. LEAD-PLANT.</h3>

<h4><i>Amorpha Californica</i>, Nutt. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs three to over eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly alternate;
with stipules; pinnate. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;One inch long; five to nine or more
pairs. <i>Flower-spikes.</i>&mdash;Two to six inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Black-purple;
two and a half lines long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Half as long. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With
only one petal! (the standard); this erect and folded. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Slightly
united at base; exserted. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Three
lines long. (See <i>Leguminosæ</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from
Marin County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>This shrub or small tree is remarkable for its sickeningly
fragrant foliage. The small blossoms, taken individually, are
inconspicuous, but when seen in masses, sprinkling the foliage
with black and gold, they are quite effective.</p>


<h3>BLUE-CURLS.</h3>

<h4><i>Trichostema lanceolatum</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>One or two feet high; branching from the base. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite;
sessile; crowded; lanceolate or ovate-lanceolate; gradually acuminate;
densely pubescent; several-nerved; an inch or more long.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Blue; in axillary, short-peduncled, dense clusters. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six lines long; with filiform tube; and border
with five almost similar lobes. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; of two lengths.
Filaments filiform; long-exserted and curled. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seed like
nutlets. Style long; filiform; two-cleft at the tip. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
Western California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Of all the plants of our acquaintance, the common blue-curls
is the most aggressive and ill-smelling. Its odor is positively
sickening. Some years ago, when it was first new to
me, I brought some of it down from Sonoma County upon the
train, and, even though it had been carefully wrapped, I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[ 316]</a></span>
obliged to deposit it in the wood-box, as far as possible from
the passengers.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from two Greek words, signifying
<i>hair</i> and <i>stamen</i>, and was bestowed on account of the capillary
filaments. The common name also refers to the long,
curling blue stamens.</p>

<p>This species blossoms late in summer, and grows upon very
dry ground, where it seems almost a miracle for any plant to
thrive.</p>


<h3>ROMERO. WOOLLY BLUE-CURLS.</h3>

<h4><i>Trichostema lanatum</i>, Benth. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubby; two to five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite and fascicled
in the axils; an inch or so long; green above; white-woolly beneath.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Blue; in terminal clusters sometimes a foot long; covered
with dense violet wool. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Nearly an
inch long; with tube half its length and border violet-shaped. <i>Stamens
and Style.</i>&mdash;Two inches long. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
San Diego to Santa Barbara.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the first scorching winds of the desert have withered
and laid low the lovely flowers of the southern plains, the
Romero is just coming into bloom upon dry hillsides. Its
shrubby form, with densely crowded leaves, becomes conspicuous
by reason of its long spikes of purple-woolly buds and
blossoms. This inflorescence is an exquisite thing, more like
the production of a Paris milliner than a guileless creation of
nature. The individual blossoms have much the look of alert
little blue violets wearing long, elegant lilac aigrets. Both leaf
and flower have a pleasant aromatic fragrance, entirely unlike
the dreadful odor of the common blue-curls.</p>

<p>Among the Spanish-Californians it is known altogether by
the musical name of "Romero," and is one of their most
highly valued medicinal herbs, being considered a panacea for
many troubles. Fried in olive oil, it becomes an ointment
which alleviates pain and cures ulcers; dried and reduced to
powder, it is a snuff very efficacious for catarrh; and made
into a tincture, it is used as a liniment. This plant is also
sometimes called "black sage."</p>

<h3>HARVEST BRODIÆA. LARGE-FLOWERED BRODIÆA.</h3>

<h4><i>Brodiæa grandiflora</i>, Smith. Lily Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[ 318]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Corm.</i>&mdash;Fibrous-coated. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Narrowly linear; somewhat
cylindrical. <i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Four to twelve inches high. <i>Pedicels.</i>&mdash;Three to

Ventura to the British boundary in the Coast Ranges and Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the latter part of May and early in June, just as the grain
is mellowing in the fields, the dry grasses of our hill-slopes and
roadsides begin to reveal the beautiful blossoms of the "harvest
Brodiæa." Seen at its best, this is one of our finest species.
It sends up a scape a foot high, bearing from five to ten of the
large, lily-like, violet flowers. They are somewhere described
as varying to rose. I have never seen them of this color,
though a flash of them caught when riding by a field is often
suggestive of a pink flower.</p>

<p>These plants vary considerably in size, in some localities
blooming when but an inch or two high, and in others having
their tall scape crowned with as many as ten of the fine blossoms.
These have their segments nerved with brown upon the
outside. The clear-white stamens stand opposite the outer segments,
alternating with the white staminodia. The leaves have
dried away before the coming of the blossoms.</p>

<p><i>B. terrestris</i>, Kell., common throughout Central California,
is always found in sandy soil. Its perianth is less than an inch
long, and its staminodia are yellow, with inrolled edges. This
is clearly distinguished by these characteristics, added to the
fact that its flower-cluster has no common stalk or scape, but
seems to sit upon the ground, giving the separate flowers the
appearance of coming from the ground.</p>

State.</p></blockquote>

<p>When the first dryness of summer is beginning to make
itself felt, the tall wandlike sprays of the little lilac snapdragon
begin to appear along our dusty roadsides. A curious feature
of this plant is to be found in the long threadlike branchlets
produced in the axils of the leaves. These are like so many
little arms, apparently waving about in aimless abandon, but in
reality vigilant of any opportunity to grasp some convenient
object of support.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>A. glandulosum</i>, Lindl.&mdash;is common
from Santa Cruz southward. This may be known by its pink
and yellow flowers, its very viscid, leafy stems, three to five
feet tall, and its lack of prehensile branchlets. This has somewhat
more the look of the familiar garden species. Its anthers
are arranged like teeth in the roof of its mouth, and the children,
by slightly pinching the sides of its funny little countenance,
can make it open its mouth in quite a formidable
manner.</p>

<p>Sir John Lubbock, writing of the fertilization of flowers,
says: "Thus the <i>Antirrhinum</i>, or snapdragon, is completely
closed, and only a somewhat powerful insect can force its way
in. The flower is in fact a strong-box, of which the humble-bee
only has the key."</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN HAREBELL. BELLFLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Campanula prenanthoides</i>, Durand. Harebell or Campanula Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[ 322]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; ovate-oblong

to five-celled. Style club-shaped; much exserted. Stigma becoming
three-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Coast woods from Monterey to Mendocino County,
and through the northern Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fragile blossoms of the harebell lurk in the seclusion of
our cool cañons or peer down at us from the banks of shaded
mountain roads toward the end of July. We almost wonder
that this ethereal flower dares delay its coming so long when
outside its cool retreat all is parched and dry. It forms a delicate
contrast to its more robust English sister, the harebell so
often celebrated by the poets.</p>


<h3>SELF-HEAL. HEAL-ALL.</h3>

<h4><i>Brunella vulgaris</i>, L. Mint Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six to fifteen inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Opposite; petioled;
ovate or oblong. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In a dense, short spike, with broad, leafy
bracts; purple, violet, or rarely white. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate; upper lip
with three short teeth; the lower two-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate; upper
lip arched, entire; lower three-lobed; deflexed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; in
pairs. Filaments two-forked; one fork naked, the other bearing the
two-celled anther. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four seedlike nutlets. Style filiform;
two-cleft above. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely distributed over the Northern Hemisphere.</p></blockquote>

<p>From April to July the purple blossoms of the self-heal, or
heal-all, may be found in the borders of woods or in open
grounds.</p>

<p>The generic name is thought to come from the old German
word, <i>braune</i>, a disease of the throat, for which this plant was
believed to be a cure. According to the old doctrine of signatures,
plants by their appearance were supposed to indicate
the diseases for which nature intended them as remedies, and
in England the <i>Brunella</i> was considered particularly efficacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[ 324]</a></span>
in the disorders of carpenters and common laborers, because
its corolla resembled a bill-hook. Hence it was commonly
called "carpenter's herb," "hook-heal," and "sicklewort."</p>

Upper lip two-cleft; lower cleft into three linear divisions. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four;
in pairs; exserted. Anther cells divergent. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of
four seedlike nutlets. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the State; common.</p></blockquote>

<p>Owing to their resemblance to the <i>Monarda</i>, or horsemint
of the East, these Western plants have been given the diminutive
of its name&mdash;<i>Monardella</i>.</p>

<p>In early summer the blossoms, which are generally purple,
are conspicuous in our drying woods. The herbage is pleasantly
fragrant. The more hairy form, which suggested the
specific name, is found in the south.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>M. lanceolata</i>, Gray&mdash;common in the
Sierras and south to San Diego, is a very handsome plant with
lanceolate or oblong-lanceolate, entire leaves, an inch or two
long, and having its bright rose-colored or purple corollas
sometimes dark-spotted. This is known among the Spanish-Californians
as "poléo" (pennyroyal), and is valued as a remedy
for various ailments.</p>

<p><i>M. odoratissima</i>, Benth., found abundantly in the Sierras,
and known as "wild pennyroyal," is a bushy, many-stemmed
plant, whose flowers usually have a faded lavender hue. But
the plant is exceedingly fragrant, perfuming the air all about.</p>

<h3>LUCERN. ALFALFA. CHILEAN CLOVER.</h3>

<h4><i>Medicago sativa</i>, L. Pea Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[ 326]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Perennials, with roots sometimes reaching down eight or ten feet.

six lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine united; one free. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;Spirally
coiled; without spines. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Usually escaped from cultivation.</p></blockquote>

<p>The value of this little plant has been known for many centuries.
It was introduced into Greece from Media, whence it
received the name <i>Medicago</i>, and was cultivated several centuries
before Christ. It has reached us through Mexico and
Chile, where it is called "alfalfa" and "Chilean clover."</p>

<p>It is but sparingly naturalized among us, but on account of
its very nutritious herbage it is largely cultivated for feed. Its
very deep root enables it to seek moisture from perennial
sources, and to thus withstand the dryness of our summers.
It requires considerable care to start the plants; but once
established, the roots will continue under favorable circumstances
to produce crops of herbage almost indefinitely. When
grown upon good soil and irrigated, it will yield several crops
a year. When cured for hay, it is cut just before flowering.
But it is of greatest value for feeding green to dairy cows and
other animals. An alfalfa field is a beautiful and grateful sight
amid the drouth of our late summer. In Chile sprays of this
plant are laid about in the houses to drive away fleas.</p>


<h3>SQUAW'S CARPET. MAHALA MATS.</h3>

in loose clusters on stout peduncles. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;With thick, often red,
flesh; with three large wrinkled, somewhat spreading horns from near
the apex, and low intermediate crests. (See <i>Ceanothus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Sierras and northern Coast Ranges.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon half-shaded slopes in the Sierras, where great firs rear
their noble shafts, forming an open forest, this little trailing
shrub makes a clean, delightfully springy carpet underfoot.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[ 328]</a></span>
Early in the season it is an exquisite thing, when covered with
its delicate clusters of bright-blue flowers, and it is no less
attractive in late summer, when its odd scarlet fruit studs the
rich green foliage.</p>

<p>The children of our mountain districts know it as "squaw's
carpet" and "mahala mats." Among the Digger Indians the
word "Mahala" is applied as a title of respect to all the women
of the tribe indiscriminately, and they always refer to one
another as "Mahala Sally," "Mahala Nancy," etc.</p>


<h3>ACONITE. MONK'S-HOOD. FRIAR'S-CAP. BLUEWEED.</h3>

three; becoming divergent follicles. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>A. Fischeri</i>, Reichb.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras and the northern Coast Ranges.</p></blockquote>

<p>The blossoms of the monk's-hood, or aconite, may be found
with those of the tall blue larkspur and the little alpine lily
along our mountain streams in late summer. Owing to the
shape of the upper sepal, these flowers have received several
of their common names, such as "helmet-flower," "friar's-cap,"
and "monk's-hood."</p>

<p>The genus <i>Aconitum</i> has been known from remote times
and noted for the poisonous qualities of its species. From the
roots and leaves of <i>A. napellus</i>, the officinal species, supposed
to be native of Britain, is made the powerful drug, aconite.
Our own species is also poisonous, and among the mountaineers
it is called "blueweed," and remembered only for its disastrous
effect upon their sheep, who are sometimes driven to eat it
when other feed is scare. The helmet varies greatly in breadth
and length.</p>

<p>This genus was named for Gentius, an ancient king of Illyria,
who is said to have discovered the medicinal virtues of
these plants. The drug called "gentian," a bitter tonic, is
made from the root of a German species&mdash;<i>G. lutea</i>&mdash;with yellow
flowers.</p>

<p>All the Gentians are natives of the cooler portions of the
world, inhabiting northern latitudes and mountain heights.
We have several fine species, which are found in the Sierras
and the northern Coast Ranges.</p>

<p><i>G. calycosa</i> is a truly beautiful flower, rivaling the sky with

with tangles of larkspur, great willow-herb, and monk's-hood,
are followed by open, velvety meadows, starred by white and
blue daisies, or diversified by the pure spikes of the milk-white
rein-orchis, or the lovely blossoms of the pink mimulus; while

<p>We have not as many species of <i>Aster</i> as are found in the
Eastern States, but we have some very beautiful ones. <i>A.
Chamissonis</i> is one of our commonest and most widespread
species. Its blossoms begin to appear in late summer and linger
along through the fall. Many species of <i>Erigeron</i> (very
closely allied to <i>Aster</i>) are called "asters" among us, and

<p>Of all the beautiful flowers of the Sierras, not one lingers so
fondly in the memory, after our return to the lowlands, as this
exquisite lavender daisy. Late in the summer it stars the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[ 334]</a></span>
alpine meadows with its charming flowers, or stands in sociable
companies on those natural velvet lawns of the mountains. It
resembles the feathery, white mountain daisy, and grows in the
same region; but its rays are wider and give the blossoms a
somewhat more substantial look.</p>


<h3>BLUE FORGET-ME-NOT. STICKSEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Echinospermum floribundum</i>, Lehm. Borage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two feet or so high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong to linear-lanceolate;
two to five inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In numerous, slender-panicled
racemes; on short, slender pedicels. Racemes often in pairs. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted;
minute. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Sky-blue (rarely white); salver-form,
with short tube and spreading, five-lobed border; two to five lines
across, with conspicuous arching crests in the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
included; on the corolla. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Of four nutlets; each having
a deltoid, keeled disk and margined by long, flat prickles. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
California to British Columbia and eastward.</p></blockquote>

<p>The beautiful blossoms of the wild blue forget-me-not will
be readily recognized by all lovers of flowers. They may be
found in the Sierras in midsummer. The tall stems rise amid
the lush grasses upon the sides of steep cañons, where the air is
humid and vegetation is rank. The flowers are unfortunately
followed by very troublesome burs, which are much dreaded
by sheep-herders.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[ 335]</a></span></p>

<h3>INDIAN WARRIOR.</h3>

<h4><i>Pedicularis densiflora</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Root woody. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Six to twenty inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
oblong-lanceolate; pinnate; leaflets lobed and toothed; diminishing
into the flower-bracts. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five-toothed.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Club-shaped, bent downward above the calyx and oblique
to it; one inch long; the two upper lobes united and containing the
stamens; the three lower mere teeth. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four. Style filiform;
exserted. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout Western California.</p></blockquote>

<p>These blossoms, which come early in the season, seem
"warmed with the new wine of the year." They often stand
in little companies in openings among the trees, and the rays
of the afternoon sun slanting in upon them brighten and vivify
them into a rich, warm claret-color. The leaves, finely dissected,
like certain fern-fronds, are often of a bronze tone,
which harmonizes finely with the flowers.</p>

<p>To the casual observer, this flower resembles the Indian
paint-brush. In reality, it belongs to a closely allied genus.
But in this blossom the bracts do not constitute the brilliant
part of the inflorescence, and the calyx, instead of being the
showy, sheathing envelop it is in the paint-brush, is quite small
and inconspicuous.</p>

<p>Mrs. Blochman has quaintly and aptly alluded to the corolla
of this flower as a long and slender mitten, just fit for some
high-born fairy's hand.</p>

<p>Among the children of our mountain districts this flower is
known as "Indian warrior."</p>

<h3>WILD GOOSEBERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Ribes Menziesii</i>, Pursh. Saxifrage Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[ 338]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to six feet high, with naked glandular-bristly or prickly
branches and stout triple thorns under the fascicled leaves. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;With
one or two drooping, Fuchsia-like flowers. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Half an
inch long; garnet; the five oblong lobes somewhat longer than the
tube, but hardly longer than the stamens, which surpass the five white
petals with inrolled edges. Styles exserted. Anthers sagittate. <i>Berry.</i>&mdash;Four
to six lines in diameter; thickly covered with long prickles.
(Otherwise as <i>Ribes glutinosum</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Diego to Humboldt
County; also in the Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild gooseberry, considered as a fruit, is very disappointing,
as its large, prickly berries are composed mostly of
skin and seeds. But as an ornamental shrub it is very pleasing.
In February its long, thorny branches are densely clothed
with small but rich green leaves, under which hang the perfect
little miniature red and white Fuchsias.</p>

<p>A closely allied species&mdash;<i>R. subvestitum</i>, Hook. and Arn.,&mdash;has
long exserted filaments and glandular-prickly berries.</p>


<h3>FUCHSIA-FLOWERED GOOSEBERRY.</h3>

<h4><i>Ribes speciosum</i>, Pursh. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs six to ten feet high, with spreading branches, armed with
large triple thorns. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Evergreen; three- to five-lobed; an inch
or so long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright cardinal; an inch long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Petaloid;
its tube adnate to the ovary; the limb is usually five-cleft (sometimes
four). <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;On the sinuses of the calyx. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;As
many as the petals; twice the length of the calyx. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled.
Style two-cleft. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A dry, densely glandular berry. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
Monterey to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the most charming shrubs to be found in the southern
part of the State is the Fuchsia-flowered gooseberry. Early
in the season the long sprays of its spreading branches are
thickly hung with the beautiful drooping cardinal flowers, which
gleam against the rich green of the glossy leaves. The stems
often rival the flowers in brilliance of coloring, but they harbor
a multitude of formidable thorns which serve to cool our impetuous
desire to possess ourselves of the blossoms. Though far
more brilliant than the flowers of <i>R. subvestitum</i>, these are not
so truly counterparts in miniature of the garden Fuchsia as they.</p>

<h3>WILD PEONY.</h3>

<h4><i>Pæonia Brownii</i>, Dougl. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[ 340]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Coarse, leathery herbs, with woody roots. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; branched;
ten to eighteen inches high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; once- or twice- ternately
compound; the leaflets ternately lobed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Solitary;
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Green; often with leaflike appendages. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five to ten;
dark red. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Numerous. <i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Two to five; becoming
leathery follicles. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Almost throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our wild peony, which is the only species of North America,
grows through a wide range of territory, from the hot
plains of the south to the region of perpetual snow in the
mountains of the north. As might be expected, it manifests
considerable variation in form and character. Indeed, some
authors have thought these variations sufficiently marked to
warrant the division of the species into two.</p>

<p>After the first rains in the south, the plant pushes up its
broad, scarlet-tipped leaves, and by January, or earlier, produces
its flowers, which are deep red, shading almost into
black, an inch or so across, and quite fragrant. These blossoms
are at first erect; but as the seed-vessels mature, the
stems begin to droop, till the fruit rests upon the ground.</p>

<p>The Spanish-Californians consider the thick root an excellent
remedy for dyspepsia, when eaten raw; while the Indians
of the south use it, powdered or made into a decoction, for
colds, sore throat, etc. In the north its leaves are reputed to
be poisonous to the touch.</p>

<p>In some localities it is known as "Christmas-rose," and in
others the children call its dark, round flowers "nigger-heads."
In the mountains it blossoms in June and July near snow-banks.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN FIGWORT. CALIFORNIAN BEE-PLANT.</h3>

<h4><i>Scrophularia Californica</i>, Cham. Figwort Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[ 342]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to five feet high; angled. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Oblong-ovate or
oblong-triangular; two or more inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; dull
red; three to five lines long; in loose terminal panicles. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-lobed.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Bilabiate; upper lip four-lobed; lower of one
lobe. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four perfect; in pairs; and a fifth scalelike, rudimentary
one. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style exserted. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Almost
throughout the State.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tall stems of the Californian figwort are common along
roadsides, and become especially rank and luxuriant where the
soil has been freshly stirred. The plants are so plentiful and
so plebeian in appearance, that we are apt to class them in the
category of weeds; but the fact that their little corollas are
almost always stored abundantly with honey for the bees, saves
them from this reproachful title.</p>

<p>They are cultivated by the keepers of bees. The odd,
little dull-red or greenish flowers have a knowing look, which
is enhanced by two of the stamens, which project just over the
lower rim of the corolla, like the front teeth of some tiny
rodent.</p>


<h3>FALSE ALUM-ROOT.</h3>

<h4><i>Tellima grandiflora</i>, R. Br. Saxifrage Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Radical-leaves.</i>&mdash;Long-petioled. <i>Stem-leaves.</i>&mdash;With shorter petioles,
round-cordate; variously lobed and toothed; very hairy, with
coarse, bristle-like hairs; two to four inches across. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to
three feet high. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In long racemes; on short pedicels; green
or rose-color. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; five-toothed; ribbed; three to
six lines long; adnate to the ovary below. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; short-clawed;
slashed above; two or three lines long; on the calyx. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
very short. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled; with a disklike summit, tapering into
two stout styles with large capitate stigmas. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Santa Cruz
to Alaska.</p></blockquote>

<p>This robust plant bears no resemblance to its delicate relative,
<i>T. affinis</i>. It is far more like the alum-root in habit and
appearance, and its leaves are prettily blotched in the same
manner. It grows along rich banks by shaded roads, and
blooms from early spring onward. Its tall racemes of either
rose-colored or greenish, obscure flowers look rather like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[ 344]</a></span>
promise of something to come than a present fulfillment. The
petals are small and inconspicuous at a distance; but when
closely examined, reveal a delicacy and beauty of form entirely
unsuspected.</p>

<h3>INDIAN PAINT-BRUSH. SCARLET PAINT-BRUSH.</h3>

<h4><i>Castilleia parviflora</i>, Bong. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Hairy, at least above; six inches to two feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Laciniate-cleft
or incised; sometimes entire; two inches or so long; mostly
alternate. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;With conspicuous colored bracts. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Tubular;
about equally cleft before and behind; tinged with scarlet or
yellow. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Tubular; six lines to over an inch long; the upper
lip equaling the tube; the lower very short; three-toothed; the whole
tinged with red or yellow. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Four; inclosed in the upper lip.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style long; exserted. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>Scarlet flowers are so rare, and nature is so chary of that
beautiful hue, that these blossoms are especially welcome.
Their dense tufts make brilliant dashes of color, which are very
noticeable amid the vivid greens of springtime. Strange to
say, most of their brilliancy is due not to the corollas, but to
the large petal-like bracts under the flowers and to the calyxes.
In the vicinity of the seashore these blossoms may be found at
almost any time of the year, while inland they have their season
of bloom in the spring, resting for the most part during
the summer.</p>

<p>They are known in some localities as "Indian plume."
The specific name is a very misleading one&mdash;for these flowers,
far from being small, are in reality comparatively large and
fine. The species was probably first named from poor or
depauperate specimens. It is in every way a larger, more
showy flower than the closely allied species&mdash;<i>C. coccinea</i>,
Spreng.&mdash;of the East, commonly known as the "painted
cup."</p>

<p>We have a number of species closely resembling one
another. <i>C. foliolosa</i>, Hook. and Arn., may be easily recognized
by its white-woolly stems and foliage.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;A foot or two high; naked or very few-leaved. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;One
to three inches in diameter; deeply three- to five-cleft, or barely
parted into obovate or cuneate divisions. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Scarlet; in loose,
open racemes; on pedicels two to four inches long. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five;
petaloid; the upper prolonged upward into a spur containing the
smaller spurs of the two upper petals. Spur six to nine lines long.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Usually four; the two lateral small, not spurred. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Many.
<i>Pistils.</i>&mdash;Mostly three; becoming divergent follicles. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Coast Ranges from San Luis Obispo to Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though not so intensely brilliant and striking as the southern
scarlet larkspur, this is a delightful flower, the sight of
which gracing some rocky cañon-wall or making flecks of flame
amid the grass, gives us a thrill of pleasure. It would require
no great stretch of the imagination to fancy these blossoms a
company of pert little red-coated elves clambering over the
loose, slender stems. In our childhood we used to hear them
called "Christmas-horns."</p>


<h3>SCARLET FRITILLARY.</h3>

<h4><i>Fritillaria recurva</i>, Benth. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Bulb as in <i>F. lanceolata</i>. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Eight to eighteen inches high;
one- to nine-flowered. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Scarlet outside; yellow, spotted
with scarlet, within. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Campanulate; urn-shaped. <i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Twelve
to eighteen lines long; with recurved tips. <i>Stamens</i>
and style not quite equaling the segments. <i>Capsule.</i>&mdash;Rather obtusely
angled. (Otherwise as <i>F. lanceolata</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras, from Placer
County northward into Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scarlet fritillary is without doubt the most beautiful of
all our species. It is a wonderful blossom, which seems as
much of a marvel to us every time we behold it as it did at first.
Usually there are from one to nine of the brilliant bells; but the
effect can be imagined when as many as thirty-five have been
seen upon a single stem!</p>

<p><i>F. coccinea</i>, Greene, is another beautiful scarlet-and-yellow
species, found in the mountains of Sonoma and Napa Counties.
This has from one to four flowers, which are an inch long, with
simple campanulate outline, without recurving tips.</p>

<p>To enjoy the exquisite airy beauty of this lovely flower,
we must seek it in its own haunts&mdash;for there is a touch of

to being handled or ruthlessly transported from its own
sylvan retreat.</p>

<p>Fringing the stream, peering over the bank, as if to see its
own loveliness reflected there, or hiding in the greenest recesses
of the woodland, it is always a welcome blossom, and

<p>This species is at home throughout our borders; but there
is another form which is said to be found occasionally in our
very high mountains&mdash;<i>A. c&#339;rulea</i>, James. This is plentiful in
the Rocky Mountains, and is the State flower of Colorado. Its
blossoms, which are blue or white, are large and magnificent,

<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Santa Barbara to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>In spring we notice in the borders of southern woodlands
and along the roadsides certain long, wandlike branches with
beautiful heart-shaped leaves, which are suggestive of those of
the garden Fuchsia. Our curiosity is naturally aroused and
we wonder what blossom is destined to grace this elegant foliage.
Early summer solves the mystery by hanging the tips
of these wands with brilliant scarlet blossoms, in every way
satisfying the earlier promise.</p>

<p>These flowers often look down at us in a sort of mocking,
Mephistophelian manner, as they hang amid the rich greens of
other shrubs and trees. Seen with a glass, they are quite
glandular. The fifth stamen looks like a very cunning little
golden hearth-brush.</p>


<h3>HUMMING-BIRD'S SAGE.</h3>

sessile; pointed. <i>Inflorescence.</i>&mdash;Over a foot long, with many large,
widely separated whorls of crimson flowers. <i>Corollas.</i>&mdash;Eighteen

sharp-pointed; often crimson-tinged. (Otherwise as <i>A. stachyoides.</i>)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from San Mateo southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This, the largest-flowered of all our <i>Audibertias</i>, becomes
especially conspicuous by April and May in southern woodlands,
where its large, dark flower-clusters may be seen in
little companies amid the shadows. The leaves and bracts are
quite viscid, and have a rather rank, unpleasant odor; but the
flowers are not without a certain comeliness. The long, crimson
trumpets are arranged in whorls about the stems, projecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[ 352]</a></span>
from many densely crowded bracts. Tier after tier of these
interrupted whorls, sometimes as many as nine, mount the
stems. The bracts and stems are usually of a rich bronze,
which harmonizes finely with the color of the flowers. The
joint in the filament is quite conspicuous in this species.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN SWEET-SCENTED SHRUB.</h3>

three to six inches long; dark green; roughish. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Wine-colored
(sometimes white); solitary; two inches or so across.
<i>Sepals</i>, petals, and stamens indefinite, passing into each other; all
coalescent below into the cuplike calyx-tube, on whose inner surface
are borne the numerous carpels. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Linear-spatulate, usually
tawny-tipped. Carpels becoming akenes. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From the lower
Sacramento River northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is one of our most beautiful shrubs. Upon the banks
of streams, or often upon a shaded hillside where some little
rill trickles out from a hidden source, it spreads its branches
and lifts its canopy of ample leaves. There is a pleasant
fragrance about the whole shrub, and the leaves, when crushed,
are agreeably bitter. From April to November the charming
flowers, like small wine-colored chrysanthemums, are produced;
and these are followed by the prettily veined, urn-shaped seed-vessels,
which remain upon the bushes until after the next season's
flowers appear, by which time they are almost black. It
is from these cuplike seed-vessels that the genus takes its
name, which is derived from two Greek words, meaning <i>flower</i>
and <i>cup.</i></p>

<h3>INDIAN PINK.</h3>

<h4><i>Silene Californica</i>, Durand. Pink Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[ 354]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;Deep. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Several; procumbent or sub-erect; leafy.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate-elliptic or lanceolate; eighteen lines to four inches
long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Brilliant scarlet; over an inch across. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-toothed.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Five; long-clawed; the blades variously cleft, and
with two erect <ins class ="mycorr" title = "Originally 'tooth-like'">toothlike</ins> appendages at the throat. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten;
exserted with the three filiform styles. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Widely
distributed.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Indian pink is one of the most beautiful of our flowers,
and it appeals to the æsthetic sense in a way few flowers do.
Its brilliant scarlet blossoms brighten the soft browns of our
roadsides in early summer, and gleam amid the green of
thickets like bits of fire. Its corolla is elegantly slashed, and
it is altogether a much finer flower than the southern form,
<i>S. laciniata</i>. Its rather broad leaves are often quite viscid to
the touch, in which respect it shares in the character from
which the genus was named in allusion to Silenus, the companion
of Bacchus, who is described as covered with foam.</p>

<p><i>S. laciniata</i>, Cav., is a similar species found from Central
California southward. It is usually a taller plant, with many
stems and narrow leaves. It is also quite viscid, and many
small insects, mostly ants, are almost always to be seen ensnared
upon its stems. We are at a loss to account for this
until we remember what Sir John Lubbock says in this connection.
He suggests that ants are not very desirable visitors for
promoting cross-fertilization among plants, as their progress is
slow, and they cannot visit many plants far apart. On the
other hand, winged insects, such as bees, butterflies, and moths,
making long excursions through the air, are admirably adapted
for bringing pollen from distant plants. Hence plants spread
their attractions for such insects, while they often contrive all
sorts of ingenious devices for keeping undesirable ones, like
ants, away from their flowers.</p>

<p class="cen"><a href="images/f139.png">INDIAN PINK&mdash;<i>Silene Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Spanish-Californians call this plant "Yerba del Indio,"
and make it into a tea which they esteem as a remedy for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[ 356]</a></span>
sorts of aches and pains, and use as a healing application to
ulcers.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>S. Hookeri</i>, Nutt.&mdash;is easily known by
its large pink flowers, often two and a half inches across, and
delicately slashed. This is found in our western counties, growing
upon wooded hillsides, where its charming flowers show to
excellent advantage.</p>


<h3>COAST LILY.</h3>

<h4><i>Lilium maritimum</i>, Kell. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Bulb</i>.&mdash;Conical; twelve to eighteen lines thick, with closely appressed
scales. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high; slender. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Seldom,
if at all, whorled; linear or narrowly oblanceolate; obtuse;
one to five inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;One to five; deep blood-red;
spotted with purple; long-pediceled; horizontal. <i>Perianth-segments.</i>&mdash;Six;
lanceolate; eighteen lines long; the upper third somewhat
recurved. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the Coast, from San Mateo to Mendocino
County.</p></blockquote>

<p>The little Coast lily is found most abundantly in the black
peat bogs of Mendocino County, though it ranges southward
to San Mateo County and northward to Humboldt County.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy says of it: "It is seldom seen farther than two
miles from the ocean. On the edges of the bogs the lily is
often a dwarf, blossoming at three or four inches. In the bogs
it roots itself in the tufts, and becomes a lovely plant five feet
high with ten or fifteen fine blossoms."</p>

<p>The leaves are dark, glossy green and the blossoms are
more cylindrical than funnel-form, the three inner segments
spreading more than the outer, which remain almost erect.
The little oval anthers, with cinnamon-colored pollen, almost
fill the narrow tube and conceal the fact that the segments are
yellow below and more decidedly spotted.</p>


<h3>CHOLLA-CACTUS.</h3>

<h4><i>Opuntia prolifera</i>, Engelm. Cactus Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Leafless, spiny, arborescent shrubs, three to ten feet high, with
elongated, cylindrical joints, covered with oblong tubercles which bear
from three to eight spines. Longest spines twelve to eighteen lines
long. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to seven inches thick. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Purplish-red;</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[ 357]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>densely clustered at the ends of the branches. <i>Sepals</i>, petals, and
stamens, many. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Style one. Stigmas several.
<i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;Green; obovate; concave on the top; having no spines, only
bristles; usually sterile; often producing other flowers. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From
Ventura to San Diego and southward.</p></blockquote>

<p>Upon dry hills, even as far north as Ventura, the cholla cactus
is a familiar feature of the landscape. In many places
it forms extensive and impassable thickets, which afford an
asylum to many delicate and tender plants that retire to it as a
last refuge from sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>The young joints, which are clustered at the ends of the
branches, are from three to nine inches long. By means of
their barbed spines, these adhere to any passing object, and as
they break off very readily, they are thus often transported to
a distance. As they root easily, this seems to afford a means
of propagation, in the absence of seed&mdash;for the fruit is usually
seedless.</p>

<p>The spines are quite variable in length, the longest being
sometimes an inch and a half. Each one is covered by a
papery sheath, which slips off easily.</p>

<p>Upon the ground about these shrubs may usually be found
the skeletons of old branches. These are hollow cylinders of
woody basket-work, which are quite symmetrical and pretty.</p>

<p><i>O. serpentina</i>, Engelm., found at San Diego, and often
growing with the above, resembles it somewhat, but may be
known by its much longer spines, which are from three to nine
inches long, and by its greenish-yellow flowers. The plants
are usually found near the seashore and scattered&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> never
forming thickets.</p>

<p>Upon the sea-coast at San Diego is found another plant
similar to the above&mdash;<i>Cereus Emoryi</i>, Engelm.&mdash;the "velvet
cactus." Instead of being covered with tubercles, these plants
have from sixteen to twenty vertical ribs, upon which are borne
the bunches of slender spines. These spines are from a quarter
of an inch to one and three quarters inches long, and
without barbs. The flowers are greenish-yellow, and not particularly
pretty or attractive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[ 358]</a></span></p>


<h3>SCARLET BUGLER.</h3>

<h4><i>Pentstemon centranthifolius</i>, Benth. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Very glaucous and smooth. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ovate-lanceolate; mostly sessile; the upper cordate-clasping;
thick. <i>Panicles.</i>&mdash;Narrow; a foot or two long. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Bright
scarlet; an inch or more long; hardly bilabiate. (See <i>Pentstemon</i>.)
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Monterey to Los Angeles.</p></blockquote>

<p>The tall spires of the scarlet bugler are such familiar sights
along southern roadsides and sandy washes that people almost
forget the enthusiastic admiration their bright beauty first
elicited. It is said that acres of mountain lands are sometimes
a solid mass of vermilion during the blooming season of this
lovely plant.</p>

<p>The panicle is often two feet long, with its string of scarlet
horns. The individual flowers bear quite a likeness to those
of the honeysuckle, common in Eastern gardens, and by those
who encounter the plant for the first time, it is usually spoken
of as "honeysuckle." The blossoms are sometimes yellow
near San Bernardino.</p>

<p><i>P. Bridgesii</i>, Gray, met more frequently in the Yosemite
than elsewhere, though it occurs in the Sierras from the Yosemite
southward, is a very similar plant to the above. But it
differs in having its corolla quite distinctly bilabiate, though of
the same general tubular, funnel-form shape.</p>


<h3>LARGE VETCH.</h3>

<h4><i>Vicia gigantea</i>, Hook. Pea Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Climbing. Stems.&mdash;Five to fifteen feet long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
pinnate; terminated by a tendril. <i>Leaflets.</i>&mdash;Ten to thirteen pairs;
linear-oblong; obtuse; mucronulate; one or two inches long. <i>Stipules.</i>&mdash;An
inch long; semi-sagittate. <i>Racemes.</i>&mdash;Dense; one-sided; five to
eighteen-flowered. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Dull red. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Papilionaceous.
Petals not spreading. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Nine united; one free. <i>Style.</i>&mdash;Hairy
all around under the stigma. <i>Pod.</i>&mdash;An inch or so long. (See
<i>Leguminosæ</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Francisco Bay northward to Sitka.</p></blockquote>

<p>This vine is usually found in moist places. Its blossoms are
never attractive for they have a faded, worn-out look, even
when they are fresh. The pods are black when ripe, and the
seeds are said to be edible.</p>

<h3>SCARLET GILIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Gilia aggregata</i>, Spreng. Phlox or Polemonium Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[ 360]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Pinnately parted into
seven to thirteen linear, pointed divisions. Upper leaves more simple.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In a loose panicle. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Deeply five-cleft; glandular.
<i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Scarlet, pink, or rarely even white; with funnel-form tube,
one inch long; and rotately spreading five-lobed border. Lobes three
to six lines long. (See <i>Gilia</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout the Sierras.</p></blockquote>

<p>The scarlet <i>Gilia</i> is a familiar flower in the Sierras in late
summer, growing everywhere in dry places. It may be easily
recognized by its rich, glossy, flat, green leaves, pinnately
divided into linear divisions, its tall, loosely branching habit,
and its bright, delicate scarlet flowers, standing out horizontally
from the stem. The corolla-lobes are often flesh-pink or yellowish
within, splashed or streaked with scarlet. The whole
plant is quite viscid.</p>


<h3>SCARLET MONKEY-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Mimulus cardinalis</i>, Dougl. Figwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Stout; viscid; hairy. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to five feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Sessile;
ovate to ovate-lanceolate; ragged-margined; several-nerved;
two or three inches long. <i>Peduncles.</i>&mdash;Three inches long. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Scarlet;
two inches or more long. Upper lip erect; its two lobes
turned back. Lower lip three-lobed; reflexed. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Exserted.
(See <i>Mimulus</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout Oregon and California along
watercourses.</p></blockquote>

<p>One day in June, when riding upon the shores of Bolinas
Bay, I came upon a spot where a cañon stream flowed out upon
a little flat at tide-level, making a small fresh-water marsh, in
which mint, bulrushes, and scarlet <i>Mimulus</i> were striving for
the mastery. But the <i>Mimulus</i> was the most wonderful I ever
saw. It stood four or five feet high&mdash;a patch of it&mdash;strong
and vigorous, and covered with its handsome, large scarlet
flowers, a sight to be remembered. This species is often cultivated
in gardens.</p>

<h3>SNOW-PLANT.</h3>

<h4><i>Sarcodes sanguinea</i>, Torr. Heath Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[ 362]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Fleshy, glandular-pubescent plants; six inches to over a foot high;
bright red; without green foliage; having, in place of leaves, fleshy
scales, with glandular-ciliate margins. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Short-pediceled.
<i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Five. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Six lines long; campanulate; with five-lobed
limb. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Ten. Anthers two-celled; opening terminally.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Five-celled; globose. Style stout. Stigma capitate. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout
the Sierras, from four to nine thousand feet elevation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I shall never forget finding my first snow-plant. It was
upon a perfect August day in the Sierras. Following the
course of a little rill which wound among mosses and ferns
through the open forest where noble fir shafts rose on every
hand, I came unexpectedly upon this scarlet miracle, standing
in the rich, black mold in a sheltered nook in the wood. A
single ray of strong sunlight shone upon it, leaving the wood
around it dark, so that it stood out like a single figure in a
<i>tableau vivant</i>. There was something so personal, so glowing,
and so lifelike about it, that I almost fancied I could see the
warm life-blood pulsing and quivering through it. I knelt to
examine it. In lieu of leaves, the plant was supplied with
many overlapping scalelike bracts of a flesh-tint. These were
quite rigid below and closely appressed to the stem, but above
they became looser and curled gracefully about among the
vivid red bells.</p>

<p>I had heard that the plant was a root parasite; so it was
with much interest and great care I dug about it with my
trowel. But I failed to find its root connected with any other.
I have since learned that it is now considered one of those
plants akin to the fungi, which in some mysterious way draw
their nourishment from decaying or decomposing matter.</p>

<p>I carried my prize home, where it retained its beauty for a
number of days. I afterward found many of them. They
gradually follow the receding snows up the heights; so that late
in the season one must climb for them.</p>

<div class="image" id="f142"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f142.png">SNOW-PLANT&mdash;<i>Sarcodes sanguinea</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The name "snow-plant" is very misleading, because from
it one naturally expects to find the plant growing upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[ 364]</a></span>
snow. But this is rarely or never the case, for it is <i>after</i> the
melting of the snow that it pushes its way aboveground.</p>

<p>Late in the season the plant usually has one or more well-formed
young plants underground at its base. These are all
ready to come forth the next season at the first intimation that
the snow has gone, which easily accounts for its marvelously
rapid growth. By the end of August, the seed-vessels are
well developed, and as large as a small marble, but flattened;
and by that time the plants have lost their brilliant coloring,
and become dull and faded.</p>

<p>It is said that the stems have been boiled and eaten, and
found quite palatable; but this would seem to the lover of the
beautiful like eating the showbread from the ark of Nature's
tabernacle.</p>


<h3>SOUTHERN SCARLET LARKSPUR.</h3>

<h4><i>Delphinium cardinale</i>, Hook. Buttercup or Crowfoot Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Three to ten feet tall. Leaves.&mdash;Large; five- to seven-lobed
nearly to the base, the lobes three- to five-cleft, with long-pointed
segments. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Large. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Lanceolate; eight lines or
more long; rotately spreading; the spur an inch or more long; pointed.
<i>Upper petals.</i>&mdash;Orange, tipped with red; pointed; standing prominently
forward. (Otherwise as <i>D. nudicaule</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The mountains,
from Ventura County to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>During all the long springtime, Nature has been quietly
making her preparations for a grand floral <i>denouement</i> to take
place about mid-June. If we go out into the mountains of the
south at that season, we shall be confronted with a blaze of
glory, the like of which we have probably never witnessed
before. This is due to the brilliant spires of the scarlet larkspur,
which sometimes rise to a height of ten feet!</p>

<p>One writer likens the appearance of these blossoms, as they
grow in dense masses, to a hill on fire; and Mr. Sturtevant
writes: "To come upon a large group of these plants in full
bloom for the first time, is an event never to be forgotten. I
first saw a mass of them in the distance from the top of a hill.
Descending, I came upon them in such a position that the rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[ 365]</a></span>
of the setting sun intensified the brilliancy of their fiery orange-scarlet
color. I gathered a large armful of stalks, from three
to seven feet high, and placed them in water. They continued
to expand for several weeks in water."</p>

<p>There is a general resemblance between this and the northern
scarlet larkspur, but the clusters of this are far larger and
denser, and the individual flowers are finer. The half-opened
buds more resemble the open flowers of <i>D. nudicaule</i>; but the
fully expanded flowers have the form of some of the finest of
the blue larkspurs.</p>

<p>The plants affect a sandy soil or one of decomposed granite.</p>


<h3>WESTERN CARDINAL-FLOWER.</h3>

<h4><i>Lobelia splendens</i>, Willd. Lobelia Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Two to four feet tall; slender, smooth or nearly so.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; mostly sessile; lanceolate or almost linear; glandular-denticulate.
<i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In an elongated, wandlike raceme; cardinal
red. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-cleft. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;With straight tube, over an
inch long and split down the upper side; border two-lipped; upper lip
with two rather erect lobes; lower spreading and three-cleft, with lobes
three to six lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five; united into a tube above.
Anthers somewhat hairy. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Two-celled. Style simple. Stigma
two-lobed. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;San Diego, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles
Counties, and eastward to Texas.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Western cardinal-flower quite closely resembles <i>L. cardinalis</i>
of the East, differing from it in a few minor points only.
I have never been fortunate enough to see it; but I am told that
it is a magnificent plant, and that from July to September many
a wet spot in our southern mountain cañons is made gay with
its brilliant blossoms.</p>

<p>Of the Eastern plant Mr. Burroughs writes: "But when
vivid color is wanted, what can surpass or equal our cardinal-flower?
There is a glow about this flower, as if color emanated
from it as from a live coal. The eye is baffled and does not
seem to reach the surface of the petal; it does not see the texture
or material part as it does in other flowers, but rests in a
steady, still radiance. It is not so much something colored as
it is color itself. And then the moist, cool, shady places it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[ 366]</a></span>
affects usually, where it has no rivals, and where the large,
dark shadows need just such a dab of fire! Often, too, we see
it double, its reflected image in some dark pool heightening its
effect."</p>


<h3>HUMMING-BIRD'S TRUMPET. CALIFORNIA FUCHSIA.</h3>

<h4><i>Zauschneria Californica</i>, Presl. Evening-Primrose Family.</h4>

<p>Woody plants, more or less villous. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Much branched;
ascending or decumbent; one to three feet long. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Mostly
alternate; sessile; narrowly lanceolate to ovate; six to eighteen lines
long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Bright scarlet; in a loose spike; funnel-form; twenty
lines long. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Scarlet; four-cleft. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Four; obcordate;
borne on the calyx-tube. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Eight. Filaments and style
more or less exserted. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Four-celled; inferior. Stigma four-lobed.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Plumas County to Mexico; and the Rocky Mountains
east of the Great Basin.</p>

<p>In late summer and through the autumn, the brilliant blossoms
of the California Fuchsia brighten the sombre tones of our
dry, open hill-slopes. Its aspect is one of gay insouciance,
which would drive away melancholy despite oneself, and
though other plants have been put to rout, one by one, by
the sun's fierce glare, nothing daunted, it puts on its brightest
hues, like a true apostle of cheerfulness. It has been cultivated
for some time, and is highly prized in Eastern gardens,
where it has earned for itself the pretty title of "humming-bird's
trumpet." It is not confined to our limits, but extends
southward into Mexico, and eastward to Wyoming. We have
seen it flourishing in the Sierras, where it is particularly beautiful.</p>

<p>It is called "balsamea" by the Spanish-Californians, who
use a wash of it as a remedy for cuts and bruises.</p>

<p>It varies greatly in the size and hairiness of its leaves, in
the form of its flowers, which are broadly or narrowly funnel-form,
and in the exsertion of the stamens and style. The <i>var. microphylla</i>
has a woolly pubescence, linear leaves often very
small, three or four lines long, and other small leaves crowded
in their axils. This is found in the south.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;A small membranous-coated corm. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Radical;
linear; equaling the slender scape. <i>Scapes.</i>&mdash;Three to twelve inches
high, bearing an umbel of small greenish-white flowers, subtended by
several small lanceolate to linear bracts. <i>Pedicels.</i>&mdash;Five to fifteen;
two to twelve lines long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Almost rotate; of six segments;
two or three lines long. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Globose; three-celled.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast, from Marin County to Monterey; also
inland.</p></blockquote>

<p>The generic name of this little plant is <i>Allium</i> reversed.</p>

<p>Though it has a coated bulb like the onion, it has none of
its garlic flavor. It differs from the other umbellate-flowered
genera of the Lily family in not having its flowers jointed upon
their pedicels. It thus seems to be a link between the onion,
on the one hand, and the beautiful <i>Brodiæas</i> and <i>Bloomerias</i>,
on the other. It is not at all an attractive plant, though its
blossoms are pleasantly fragrant.</p>

<p>It is found on the borders of salt marshes and in subsaline
soils in the interior, as well as upon high hills in stony soils.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>M. serotina</i>, Greene&mdash;common upon
inland hills in the south, is quite a delicate, pretty flower. Its
greenish-white blossoms, with dainty Nile-green anthers, are
nearly an inch across, and each segment has a pale-green mid-nerve.
The plant has a number of very long, slender leaves,
and its flower-stems are sometimes two feet tall and very
slender.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[ 370]</a></span></p>


<h3>SILK-TASSEL TREE. QUININE-BUSH.</h3>

<h4><i>Garrya elliptica</i>, Dougl. Dogwood Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs five to eight feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Leathery; white-woolly
beneath; wavy-margined. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Of two kinds on separate shrubs;
in solitary or clustered catkins; and without petals. <i>Staminate catkins.</i>&mdash;Two
to ten inches long, consisting of a flexile chain of funnel-form
bracts, depending one from another; each having six flowers like clappers.
These flowers with four hairy sepals and four stamens with distinct
filaments. <i>Pistillate catkins.</i>&mdash;Of similar structure but stouter,
more rigid. Their flowers without floral envelopes; pistils two; fleshy
and hairy; stigmas filiform; dark. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the Coast from Monterey
County to Washington.</p></blockquote>

<p>This shrub might easily be mistaken for one of our young
live-oaks, with its leathery leaves and gray bark; but the leaves
are opposite, and not alternate, as with the oaks. The bark
and leaves have an intensely bitter principle, similar to quinine
and equally efficacious.</p>

<p>Early in February, after the first spell of balmy weather,
the bushes put forth their flowers, and then they are exceedingly
beautiful. The long pale-green chains at the ends of all
the branches hang limp and flexile, shaken with every breath
of wind, or, falling over other branches, drape and festoon the
whole shrub exquisitely. The catkins of the female shrub are
stouter and more rigid than those of the male; but when the
fruit is mature, they lengthen out into beautifully tinted clusters
of little papery-coated grapes, which are quite attractive in
themselves. This is cultivated as an ornamental shrub in
England.</p>

<p><i>G. Fremonti</i>, Torr., another species, is distinguished by
having its leaves pointed at both ends, not wavy-margined, and
not permanently woolly; and also by its solitary catkins. This
is the shrub usually spoken of as "quinine-bush," "fever-bush,"
etc., and whose leaves were used as a substitute for quinine in
the early days among the miners. It is said that its roots, left
in the ground after the cutting of the shrub, become marbled
with green, and are then very beautiful for inlaying in ornamental
woodwork.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIA LAUREL.</h3>

<h4><i>Umbellularia Californica</i>, Nutt. Laurel Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[ 372]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs or trees, ten to one hundred feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate;
short-petioled; lanceolate-oblong; two to four inches long; smooth,
shining green; very aromatic. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;In clusters. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Six;

<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From Oregon to San Diego.</p></blockquote>

<p>Early in February we usually have some of our loveliest
days. Life is then pulsing and throbbing everywhere at full tide.
The clear sunshine, the murmur of streams, the odor of the
freshly turned sod, the caroling of larks all are eloquent of
the springtime. The whole air is filled with a strange, spicy
fragrance which makes it a delight to breathe. The California
laurel is shaking out a delicious, penetrating odor from its
countless blossoms.</p>

<p>Mr. Sargent refers to this tree as one of the stateliest and
most beautiful inhabitants of the North American forests, and
one of the most striking features of the California landscape.</p>

<p>In France it is now much appreciated and cultivated in
parks and gardens.</p>

<p>In Southern California it is only a shrub; but in the central
and northern counties it becomes a magnificent tree, a hundred
feet in height and from four to six feet in diameter. It thrives
best in the rich soil along stream-banks, though it grows also
upon hillsides. It would be impossible to mistake this tree for
any other; for its leaves, when crushed, give out a peculiar pungent
odor which, if inhaled too much, will cause headache.
The odor is something like that of bay-rum. The Indians, as
well as our own people, acting upon the homeopathic principle,
use them as a remedy for headache. The oil is also used
effectively in toothache, earache, etc., and enters into the composition
of certain patent medicines.</p>

<p>The wood of the laurel is one of the most beautiful employed
by the cabinet-maker, and it is largely used in the manufacture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[ 373]</a></span>
of choice furniture. The olive-like fruit is ripe by July, and
would remain upon the tree until the next year were not the
squirrels so fond of it.</p>

<p>This tree is known in different localities by a variety of
names, such as "spice-bush," "balm of heaven," "sassafras
laurel," "cajeput," "California bay-tree," "California olive,"
"mountain laurel," and "California laurel." But the last of
these is the one prevalent where its finest forms are found.</p>


<h3>MOUNTAIN MAHOGANY.</h3>

<h4><i>Cercocarpus parvifolius</i>, Nutt. Rose Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Shrubs two to twenty feet high; branching from a thick base.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled; cuneate; serrate across the summit;
more or less silky above; densely hoary-tomentose beneath; six
to eighteen lines long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Mostly solitary; axillary. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Narrowly
tubular, with a deciduous campanulate five-lobed limb.
<i>Petals.</i>&mdash;None. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Fifteen to twenty-five; on the calyx.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-(rarely two-) celled. Style simple. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;An akene
with a silky tail, at length becoming three or four inches long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The
Coast Ranges from Lake County to Southern California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The mountain mahogany is a common shrub upon the
interior hills of the Coast Ranges; and when one has once
made its acquaintance, it is always easily recognized by its
wedge-shaped, dark-green leaves, prominently veined and
notched at the summit. Its flowers, having no petals, are
green and inconspicuous; but the long, solitary plumes of its
little fruit are very noticeable and pretty. Its wood is the
heaviest and hardest we have.</p>

<p>Mr. Greene says that its leafy twigs have a sweet, birchy
flavor, rendering them excellent food for cattle in late summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[ 374]</a></span></p>


<h3>DUTCHMAN'S PIPE. PIPE-VINE.</h3>

<h4><i>Aristolochia Californica</i>, Torr. Birthwort Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Woody; climbing. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; short-petioled;
large; ovate-cordate, two to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Greenish,
veined with purple. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Pipe-shaped; the lobes of the lip
leather-colored within. <i>Anthers.</i>&mdash;Six; sessile; adnate in pairs to the
thick style under the broad lobes of the stigma; vertical. <i>Stigma.</i>&mdash;Three-lobed.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Inferior; six-angled; six-celled. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A
large, leathery pod two inches long. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges, from
Monterey to Marin County.</p></blockquote>

<p>This odd flower is found rather sparingly in our middle
Coast Ranges from February to April, and in some parts of
the Sierra foothills, reaching even to the Yosemite. As it
flowers before the large leaves come out, and the blossoms are
much like dead leaves in color, it requires keen eyes to find it.
It usually grows on low ground, in a tangle of shrubs under
the trees, often festooning gracefully from branch to branch.
Before the flowers are fully open, the buds resemble ugly little
brown ducks hanging from the vine.</p>

<p>The common blue-black butterfly is often seen hovering
over this vine, and it is said that its caterpillar is so fond of the
fruit that it rarely permits one to ripen.</p>

<p>Later in the season, the large cordate leaves are quite conspicuous,
and cause people to wonder what may have been the
flower of so fine a vine.</p>


<h3>TURK'S-HEAD CACTUS. TURBAN CACTUS.</h3>

<h4><i>Echinocactus viridescens</i>, Nutt. Cactus Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Depressed, hemispherical, fleshy, leafless plants, with from thirteen
to twenty-one prominent, vertical ribs, bearing groups of rigid spines;
usually less than a foot in diameter. <i>Spines.</i>&mdash;Straight or recurved;
stout; reddish; transversely ribbed or ringed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Sessile;
borne about the depressed woolly center; yellowish-green; about
eighteen lines long. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Many; closely imbricated; merging into
the numerous, oblong, scarious petals; sometimes nerved with red.
<i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Very many. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. Stigmas twelve to fifteen;
linear. <i>Berry.</i>&mdash;Pulpy; green; scaly. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;From San Diego
inland.</p></blockquote>

<div class="image" id="f145"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f145.png">DUTCHMAN'S PIPE&mdash;<i>Aristolochia Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Turk's-head cactus looks very much like the end of a
watermelon protruding from the ground, if one could imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[ 376]</a></span>
a watermelon deeply furrowed and furnished with very formidable
spines.</p>

<p>This plant is abundant near San Diego, growing all over the
mesas; and it is marvelous that horses and cattle are not more
often injured by stepping upon these disagreeable, horrent
globes; but long experience has doubtless taught them the
instinct of caution.</p>

<p>The plant is really beautiful when crowned with its circle of
gauzy, yellow-green flowers, which are more like some exquisite
artificial fabrication than real flowers. The fruit of this cactus
is slightly acid and rather pleasant.</p>

<p>The plant is cultivated in Europe under the name of <i>Echinocactus
Californicus</i>.</p>


<h3>FAIRY BELLS. DROPS OF GOLD.</h3>

<h4><i>Prosartes Hookeri</i>, Torr. Lily Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Creeping; spreading. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;A foot or two high;
branching horizontally. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; ovate; cordate; acute;
several-nerved; two or three inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Greenish; one
to six; six lines long; pendulous under the ends of the branches. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Spreading-campanulate.
<i>Segments.</i>&mdash;Six; lanceolate; arched
at the base. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six; equaling or exceeding the perianth.
<i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-celled. Style slender; entire. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;An obovate,
somewhat pubescent berry; golden, ripening to scarlet. <i>Syn.</i>&mdash;<i>Disporum
Hookeri</i>, Britt. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Coast Ranges from Marin County to
Santa Cruz; in shady woods, but not by the water.</p></blockquote>

<p>In our walks through the April woods, we often notice a
fine plant with branching stems, whose handsomely veined
leaves are set obliquely to the stem and all lie in nearly the
same horizontal plane. In our subsequent meetings with the
plant it seems to change but little, and we begin to grow impatient
for the coming of the flower, which, however, seems to
show no disposition to appear. Some day, when bending over
a bit of moss or a fern-frond, or peering into the silk-lined hole
of a ground-spider, we suddenly catch a glimmer of something
under the broad leaves of our hitherto disappointing plant, and
hastening to examine it, we find to our amazement one or
more exquisitely formed little green bells hanging from the tip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[ 377]</a></span>
of each branch. Later these are often succeeded by small berries,
at first golden, and afterward scarlet.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i>Prosartes</i>, comes from a Greek word
signifying <i>to hang from</i>, and is in allusion to the pendulous
flowers. By some authorities this plant is called <i>Disporum
Hookeri</i>. The common name, "drops of gold," applies to the
berry.</p>

<p>Another species <i>P. Menziesii</i>, Don.&mdash;is found growing
along stream-banks in the Coast Ranges from Marin County
northward. This differs from the above in its longer, more
cylindrical, <i>milk-white</i> flowers, and its salmon-colored berries.
It usually blossoms a little later than the other species, lasting
till June.</p>


<h3>COMMON MUGWORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Artemisia vulgaris, var. Californica</i>, Bess. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Rather simple; a foot or two high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Ample;
slashed downward into long acute lobes; green above; cottony-woolly
beneath; bitter; strong-scented; the upper often entire, linear or lanceolate.
<i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Minute; two lines high, one broad; composed
of tubular disk-flowers only; greenish, in long, slender, crowded panicles.
<i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the Coast, from San Francisco northward.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a common weed along our roadsides, and is easily
known by its slashed leaves with silvery under surfaces. These
leaves are very bitter. This is closely allied to the wormwood,
and by many people is called "wormwood."</p>


<h3>ARTEMISIA. SAGEBRUSH.</h3>

<h4><i>Artemisia Californica</i>, Less. Composite Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Shrubby; four or five feet high; with many slender
branches. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; pinnately parted into three- to seven-filiform
divisions; or entire and filiform; an inch or so long; strong-scented.
<i>Flower-heads.</i>&mdash;Very small; two lines or less across; numerous,
in narrow panicles; greenish; composed of tubular disk-flowers
only. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Marin County to San Bernardino.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>Artemisia</i>, or, as it is more commonly called, "sagebrush,"
is an old friend that we always expect to meet in our
walks on rocky hill-slopes. Its leaves have a clean, bitter
fragrance, similar to that of the mugwort, but sweeter, and when
crushed in the hand they emit a strong odor of turpentine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[ 378]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Behr tells me that in the early days the miners laid
sprays of it in their beds to drive away the fleas.</p>

<p>The Spanish-Californians regard it as a panacea for all ills,
and use it in the form of a strong wash to bathe wounds and
swellings, with excellent results.</p>

<p>Another species&mdash;<i>A. tridentata</i>, Nutt.&mdash;is the shrubby
form, growing so abundantly all over the alkali plains of the
Great Basin, where it holds undisputed possession with the
prairie-dog and the coyote. It has narrow, wedge-shaped
leaves, which are three-toothed at the apex; and the whole
plant has a strong odor of turpentine.</p>

<p>This is highly esteemed by the Indians as a medicinal plant.</p>


<h3>WILD PIE-PLANT. CANAIGRE.</h3>

<h4><i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>, Torr. Buckwheat Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;A cluster of Dahlia-like tubers. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;About two feet
high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Narrowly oblong or lanceolate; a foot long or less;
acute; undulate; narrowed into a short, very thick petiole. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Light
raisin-color; in a large panicle a foot or so long. <i>Perianth.</i>&mdash;Of
six sepals; the outer minute; the inner about five lines long, appressed
to the ovary. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Six. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Three-angled; one-celled.
Styles three; short. Stigmas tufted. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry, sandy plains of
Southern California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The wild pie-plant is closely related to the garden rhubarb,
and also to the dock and the sorrel. In early days in both
Utah and Southern California housewives used its stems as a
substitute for the cultivated pie-plant, finding them quite acceptable.
The Indians have long used the root in the tanning of
buckskins, and they have also found in it a bright mahogany-brown
dye, with which to paint their bodies.</p>

<p>Of late this plant has been attracting much notice under the
name "canaigre," and it is hoped that it will prove a valuable
substitute for tanbark. If it does, we shall hail it with delight
as the savior of our beautiful oak forests. Tannin exists in
large quantities in the thick roots; but it is yet a question
whether it will prove remunerative to the farmer as a crop. At
Rialto a company has been formed, which employs many men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[ 380]</a></span>
to gather and prepare the roots, and there will soon be thousands
of acres of it under cultivation. The tops of the plants,
with the small upper portions of the roots, which have all the
eyes upon them, are cut off and replanted for the next year's
crop, while the remainder of the root is sliced, dried, pulverized,
and leached to extract the tannin, which is then ready
for use.</p>

<div class="image" id="f146"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f146.png">CANAIGRE&mdash;<i>Rumex hymenosepalus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The plant is a very noticeable one, with its red leaf-stems
and veins and its large, dense cluster of small raisin-colored
flowers, and it is often seen upon our southern plains. But I
am told that over the border in Lower California it grows in
great abundance, covering the ground for miles. It would
seem as though its cultivation might be carried on with best
results where nature produces it so freely.</p>


<h3>HORNLESS WOOLLY MILKWEED.</h3>

<h4><i>Gomphocarpus tomentosus</i>, Gray. Milkweed Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p>Densely white-woolly plants, with milky juice. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;One to
three feet high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two to four inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Several,
in a pendulous cluster on yarnlike pedicels; lateral upon the stem
between the leaves. <i>Calyx.</i>&mdash;Five-parted; inconspicuous. <i>Corolla.</i>&mdash;Deeply
five-parted; greenish without, pinkish within. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Five;
sunk in the column and alternating with the five hoods. <i>Hoods.</i>&mdash;Two
lines across; saccate; open down the outer face. <i>Ovaries.</i>&mdash;Two;
pointed; capped by a flat stigma. <i>Fruit.</i>&mdash;A pair of follicles; with
many silken-tufted seeds. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Dry hills from San Diego to Monte
Diablo.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the south by late spring the very woolly stems and foliage
of this milkweed become quite noticeable before any hint of
blossoms appears. The thick, gray leaves look as though they
might have been cut out of heavy flannel. By May the flower-clusters
begin to take definite form, and at last the buds open
and reveal a most interesting flower, whose structure is quite
complicated. The center of the blossom is occupied by a
fleshy column, in which are sunk the anthers, and upon which
are borne certain round, dark wine-colored bodies called the
"hoods," which are in reality nectaries, holding honey for
insect visitors. All the pollen in each anther-cell consists of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[ 382]</a></span>
waxy mass, and the adjacent masses of different anthers are
bound together by a gummy, elastic band, suspended upon
the rim of the stigma. The stigma occupies the top of the
fleshy column, and forms a cap, hiding from view the two tubes,
or styles, leading down into the ovaries.</p>

<div class="image" id="f147"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f147.png">HORNLESS WOOLLY MILKWEED&mdash;<i>Gomphocarpus tomentosus</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The milkweeds of California are divided between two genera&mdash;<i>Asclepias</i>
and <i>Gomphocarpus</i>,&mdash;the difference between them
lying in the presence of a horn or crest rising out of the hoods
in <i>Asclepias</i>.</p>

<p>Bees visiting the, blossoms of the milkweeds are said to be
frequently disabled by the pollen-masses, which adhere to
them in such numbers and weigh them down so heavily that
they cannot climb upon their combs, but fall down and perish.</p>


<h3>MOUNTAIN LADY'S SLIPPER.</h3>

<h4><i>Cypripedium montanum</i>, Dougl. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Stout; a foot or two high; leafy. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Four to six
inches long; pointed. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;One to three; short pediceled. <i>Sepals
and petals.</i>&mdash;Brownish; eighteen to thirty lines long; the two lower
sepals united nearly to the apex. <i>Sac.</i>&mdash;An inch long; dull white,
veined with purple. <i>Anthers.</i>&mdash;Two fertile (one on either side of the
column); one sterile, four or five lines long, yellow, with purple spots
longer than the stigma. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The mountains from Central California
to the Columbia River.</p></blockquote>

<p>The mountain lady's slipper is a rare plant with us, which
affects cool, secluded spots in our mountain forests. The
plants, of which two or three usually grow from a creeping
rootstock, generally stand where some moisture seeps out.
The leaves are ample and shapely, and the quaint flowers quiet
and elegant in coloring.</p>

<p>The long, twisted sepals and petals and the oval sac give
these blossoms the aspect of some floral daddy-long-legs or
some weird brownie of the wood. We feel that we have fallen
upon a rare day when we are fortunate enough to find these
flowers, and we are reminded of Mr. Burroughs' lines: "How
fastidious and exclusive is the <i>Cypripedium</i>!... It does
not go in herds, like the commoner plants, but affects privacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[ 384]</a></span>
and solitude. When I come upon it in my walks, I seem to
be intruding upon some very private and exclusive company."</p>

<div class="image" id="f148"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f148.png">MOUNTAIN LADY'S SLIPPER.&mdash;<i>Cypripedium montanum</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>In our Coast Ranges we may look for these blossoms in
May.</p>

<p>We have but two or three species of <i>Cypripedium</i>. <i>C. Californicum</i>,
Gray, is similar to <i>C. montanum</i>, but its blossoms
have comparatively short greenish-yellow sepals and petals, and
the sac is from white to pale rose-color. They have a more
compact look, and lack the careless grace of those of the
mountain lady's slipper. Their haunts are swamps in open
woodlands in the northern part of the State, where they bloom
in August and September, and are often found in the company
of the California pitcher-plant.</p>


<h3>REIN-ORCHIS.</h3>

<h4><i>Habenaria elegans</i>, Bolander. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Root.</i>&mdash;An oblong tuber. <i>Stem.</i>&mdash;Rather slender; a foot or two
high. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Two; radical; oblong; three to six inches long; eighteen
lines to two inches wide. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Small; light green; in a
dense but slender spike. Sepals and petals about equal; two lines
long; obtuse. <i>Lip.</i>&mdash;Similar, with a filiform spur three to five lines
long. (Otherwise like <i>H. leucostachys</i>.) <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Near the coast, from
Monterey to Vancouver Island.</p></blockquote>

<p>In early summer the fragrant spikes of the rein-orchis stand
half-concealed under the trees and along the banks bordering
wooded mountain roads. The little greenish flowers are inconspicuous,
and reveal themselves only to those who have the
habit of observation. Early in the spring the rather large
lily-like leaves were far more noticeable and handsome; but
they seemed to weary of waiting for the tardy arrival of the
blossoms, and faded away long since. The little flowers are
very deliberate about unfolding themselves; and I have sometimes
watched them when they seemed for weeks at a standstill
before yielding to the summer's invitation to come forth.</p>

<p>They are arranged in a three-sided spike, on two sides of
which the long spurs interlace and cross one another in quite a
warlike manner.</p>

<h3>TEASEL. FULLER'S THISTLE.</h3>

<h4><i>Dipsacus Fullonum</i>, L. Teasel Family.</h4>

<p>The teasel is not an uncommon sight along our roadsides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[ 386]</a></span>
having spread considerably since its introduction from Europe,
some years ago. The strong stems are tall and slender, and
bear at summit the large bristly cones, surrounded by rigid,
erect bracts. These cones are the inflorescence of the plant,
and each downward-pointing little hook is a bract beneath a
flower. Before the flowers come out, the buds show their
round, green heads, packed away down among the bristles.
Then for a time the cones are ringed or covered by the delicate
flesh-colored flowers; which stand out from the bristles,
giving the cone a soft, fluffy look. After these have passed
away, the cavities in which they were stored give the cone a
pitted appearance. These burs are exquisitely symmetrical,
and have long been in use by the fuller to "tease," or raise a
nap upon cloth, whence the name, "teasel." They are cut in
halves or quarters, and these are set in frames which are
worked by machinery. Many vain attempts have been made
to manufacture an instrument to take the place of the teasel;
but it is difficult to find anything that is strong enough to do
the work that at the same time will not injure the cloth.</p>

<p>This is enumerated among the plants which are supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[ 387]</a></span>
to foretell the weather. Mr. Dyer quotes the following:&mdash;</p>
<p class="noin">.&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  .&nbsp;  "tezils, or fuller's thistle, being gathered and hanged
up in the house where the air may come freely to it, upon the
alteration of cold and windy weather will grow smoother, and
against rain will close up its prickles."</p>

<h3>SAMPHIRE. GLASSWORT.</h3>

<h4><i>Salicornia ambigua</i>, Michx. Goosefoot Family.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Though a humble enough plant in itself, the samphire, or
glasswort, is the source of a wonderful glory in our marshes in
the autumn. Great stretches of tide-land not already pre-empted
by the tule are covered by it, showing the most gorgeous
blendings of crimson, purple, olives, and bronzes, which, seen
with all the added charm of shifting and changing atmospheric
effects, far outrival any Oriental rug that could be conceived of.</p>

<p>This plant is easily known by its succulent branching, leafless
stems and from the fact that it does not grow outside of
the salt marshes. Its flowering is obscure, and all that can be
seen is a few small stamens just protruding from the surface of
the fleshy spike, which appears much like any of the other
branches, the flowers being sunk in it.</p>

<p>The generic name is derived from two Latin words&mdash;<i>sal</i>,
salt, and <i>cornu</i>, a horn&mdash;and conveys the idea of saline plants
with hornlike branches. The English name, "samphire," is of
French derivation, and comes originally from the old "l'herbe
de Saint Pierre," formerly having been written "sampêtra"
and "sampire." In Great Britain this plant is usually designated
as "<i>marsh</i> samphire," to distinguish it from the ordinary
samphire, which is a plant of the genus <i>Crithmum</i>.</p>

<p>This plant is much relished by cattle, and in England it is
made into a pickle, while on the continent it is used as a pot-herb.
Formerly, in Europe, it was burned in large quantities
for the soda contained in its ashes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[ 388]</a></span></p>


<h3>MOTTLED SWAMP-ORCHIS. FALSE LADY'S SLIPPER.</h3>

<h4><i>Epipactis gigantea</i>, Dougl. Orchis Family.</h4>

<blockquote><p><i>Rootstock.</i>&mdash;Creeping. <i>Stems.</i>&mdash;Leafy; one to four feet high.
<i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Alternate; sessile; clasping; ovate below; lanceolate above;
three to eight inches long. <i>Flowers.</i>&mdash;Three to ten; in terminal
racemes; greenish, veined with purple. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Three; petaloid;
lanceolate; an inch or less long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;The two upper about equaling
the sepals. The lip concave; saccate; eared at base; with a
jointed, pendulous tip. <i>Anther.</i>&mdash;One; sessile upon the top of the
column. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;One-celled. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;Throughout California.</p></blockquote>

<p>The casual observer usually alludes to this plant as a
"lady's slipper," and he is not so very far wrong, for it is
closely related to the <i>Cypripedium</i>, and resembles it much in
habit, in the aspect of its leafy stems, and in the general form
of its blossom. But instead of having its lip in the form of
a sac, it is open and curiously jointed, the lower portion swinging
freely, as upon a hinge. When this lid is raised, one can
fancy some winged seraph or angel enshrined within, but when
lowered the semblance is more to a monk bowed in meditation.</p>

<p>These beautiful plants will be found abundantly fringing our
streams in June and July, and the disciples of dear old Isaac
Walton who then pass down the stream with rod and line are
usually attracted by their quietly elegant colors. Dull purples
and greens predominate, though the lip is tinged with orange
or yellow.</p>

<p>In Northern California and Oregon is occasionally found a
rare and curious plant&mdash;the "phantom orchis," <i>Cephalanthera
Oregana</i>, Richenb.f. This plant is white and ghostlike
throughout, has stems a foot or two high, but no leaves&mdash;only
three to five scarious sheathing bracts. Its blossoms are
very similar in size and shape to those of <i>Epipactis gigantea</i>.</p>

<p>I have never had the pleasure of finding this floral oddity
myself; but one season a friend sent me the only plant which
was found in a thicket near a pretty camp upon the Sacramento
River, in the Shasta region.</p>

<h3>CALIFORNIAN PITCHER-PLANT. CALF'S-HEAD.</h3>

<h4><i>Darlingtonia Californica</i>, Torr. Pitcher-plant Family.</h4>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[ 390]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>Bog plants, with long horizontal rootstocks. <i>Leaves.</i>&mdash;Tubular;
hooded and appendaged above; eighteen to thirty-four inches high.
<i>Scape.</i>&mdash;Eighteen inches or more high, with green bracts crowded near
the solitary nodding flower. Flower parts in fives. <i>Sepals.</i>&mdash;Green;
twenty lines long. <i>Petals.</i>&mdash;Purplish; shorter than the sepals; constricted
above into a terminal lobe. <i>Stamens.</i>&mdash;Twelve to fifteen in
a circle around the ovary. <i>Ovary.</i>&mdash;Top-shaped; truncate; five-lobed;
five-celled. Style five-lobed. Stigmas thickish. <i>Hab.</i>&mdash;The Sierras,
from Truckee Pass into Oregon.</p></blockquote>

<p>Our pitcher-plant is one of the most wonderful and interesting
of all the forms that grow, linking, as it were, the vegetable
world with the animal, by its unnatural carnivorous
habits. If you would like to visit it, this warm July day, we
will take a mountain trail, leading around under lofty yellow
pines, Douglas spruces, and incense-cedars, making our way
through the undergrowth until we come to a swamp lying
upon a hillside yonder. While still some distance away, we
can discern the yellowish-green of the myriad hoods as they
lift themselves in the sunlight like spotted snakes.</p>

<p>If you have never seen the plant before, you will be in a
fever of excitement till you can reach the spot and actually
take one of the strange pitchers in your hand to examine it.
Nothing could be cleverer than the nicely arranged wiles of
this uncanny plant for the capturing of the innocent&mdash;yes, and
of the more knowing ones&mdash;of the insect world who come
within its enchantment. No ogre in his castle has ever gone
to work more deliberately or fiendishly to entrap his victims
while offering them hospitality, than does this plant-ogre.
Attracted by the bizarre yellowish hoods or the tall nodding
flowers, the foolish insect alights upon the former and commences
his exploration of the fascinating region. He soon
comes upon the wing, which often being smeared with a trail
of sweets, acts as a guide to lure him on to the dangerous
entrance to the hoodlike dome. Once within this hall of
pleasure, he roams about, enjoying the hospitality spread for
him. But at last, when he has partaken to satiety and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[ 392]</a></span>
fain depart, he turns to retrace his steps. In the dazzlement
of the translucent windows of the dome above, he loses sight
of the darkened door in the floor by which he entered and flies
forcibly upward, bumping his head in his eagerness to escape.
He is stunned by the blow and plunged downward into the
tube below. Here he struggles to rise, but countless downward-pointing,
bristly hairs urge him to his fate. He sinks
lower and lower in this "well of death" until he reaches the
fatal waters in the bottom, where he is at length ingulfed, adding
one more to the already numerous victims of this diabolical
plant.</p>

<div class="image" id="f151"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391"></a></span>
<p class="cen"><a href="images/f151.png">CALIFORNIAN PITCHER-PLANT&mdash;<i>Darlingtonia Californica</i>.</a></p>
</div>

<p>The fluid at the bottom of the well is secreted by the plant,
and seems to have somewhat the action of a gastric juice in
disintegrating the insects submerged in it. Many species of
ants, flies, bees, hornets, grasshoppers, butterflies, moths,
dragon-flies, beetles, etc., are to be found in the tube, sometimes
filling it to a depth of two or three inches.</p>

<p>The disagreeableness of the vicinity of these plants can be
imagined upon a hot day when the sun is shining "upon this
sad abode of death" and all the air is tainted with their sickening
odor.</p>

<p>The mountaineers call the plant "calf's-head," because of
the large yellowish domes of the pitchers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[ 393]</a></span></p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
